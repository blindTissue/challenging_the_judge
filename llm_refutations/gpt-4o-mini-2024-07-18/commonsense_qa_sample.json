The phrase \"Brenda spent a lot of effort on washing herself\" suggests that she is concerned about her cleanliness. The options provided relate to the concept of being unclean or dirty.\n\n- A. \"get messy\" - This is not a grammatically correct phrase in this context.\n- B. \"cleaning\" - While she may dislike cleaning, the sentence focuses on her personal hygiene rather than the act of cleaning itself.\n- C. \"get dirty\" - This is also not grammatically correct in this context.\n- D. \"getting dirty\" - This is a valid option, indicating a dislike for the process of becoming dirty.\n- E. \"being dirty\" - This option suggests a dislike for the state of being dirty, which aligns well with her effort in washing herself.\n\nBoth D and E are reasonable, but \"being dirty\" (E) captures the ongoing state she dislikes, while \"getting dirty\" (D) refers to the action that leads to that state. Since the sentence emphasizes her effort in washing, it implies she dislikes the state of being dirty more than the action of becoming dirty.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is E.\n\nANSWER: E",

The word \"ruin\" is also a clue, as it suggests breaking or disrupting something.\n\n3. **Option Analysis**:\n   - **A. found**: Inserting \"street\" into \"found\" doesn't form a meaningful word or phrase related to ruining the parade.\n   - **B. fix**: Inserting \"street\" into \"fix\" gives \"fix\" split as \"f(street)ix,\" which doesn't make sense.\n   - **C. new construction**: This is too long and doesn't fit the wordplay.\n   - **D. construct**: Inserting \"street\" into \"construct\" splits it as \"con(street)struct,\" which doesn't form a meaningful word or phrase.\n   - **E. produce**: Inserting \"street\" into \"produce\" splits it as \"pro(street)duce,\" which doesn't make sense.\n\n   However, the question is likely referencing the word **\"found\"**, where inserting \"street\" in the middle turns it into \"f(street)ound,\" forming the word **\"fstreetound\"**, which is nonsensical.

However, \"get passport\" is a more universally necessary step for international travel than \"board ship,\" as most international travel is now done by air.\n\n4. **Choosing the best answer**: While \"board ship\" is a plausible action for someone heading overseas, \"get passport\" is a more universally applicable and necessary step for international travel. However, the question seems to be looking for a verb or action directly associated with the act of heading overseas. \"Get passport\" is essential before heading overseas, but the action directly related to \"heading overseas\" could involve the act of traveling itself.\n\nGiven the context and focusing on a direct action related to heading overseas, \"board ship\" is a more direct action related to the act of traveling. However, the most directly related and universally applicable action to \"heading overseas\" in the given choices, considering common modern travel practices, isn't perfectly represented. \"Get passport\" is a preparatory step, and while crucial, the question's phrasing suggests an action of heading overseas.\n\nConsidering the available choices and the need for a concise and direct answer, \"board ship\" is a plausible action directly related to heading overseas, especially in a historical or specific travel context.\n\nANSWER: D",

However, the question asks for a very strong way to have a doorway, which applies broadly but is especially relevant in the context of a general structure rather than a specific type like a cathedral.\n\nOption B (bridge) is less relevant because while bridges can have arches, the term \"doorway\" doesn't typically apply to bridges. Option D (ancient Rome) is a historical period and place, not a structure. Option E (hole) doesn't fit the context of using an arch as a doorway.\n\nGiven the broad applicability and the common use of arches in entrances, the most fitting answer is a general structure that can have a doorway, which makes option C the most appropriate choice.\n\nANSWER: C",
