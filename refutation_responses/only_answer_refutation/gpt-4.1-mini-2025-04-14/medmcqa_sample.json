A palpable mass at the pubic tubercle suggests the testis is located in the inguinal canal or just proximal to the scrotum.\n\nStep 3: Consider the management of undescended testis  \n- Observation until age 5 (Option A) is generally not recommended because early orchiopexy (before 1-2 years) is preferred to reduce risks of infertility and malignancy. At 3 years, observation is not appropriate.  \n- Orchiopexy (Option B) is the standard treatment to bring the testis into the scrotum.  \n- Orchiopexy with hernia repair (Option C) is often done because undescended testes are frequently associated with a patent processus vaginalis and inguinal hernia. However, in this case, there is no evidence of hernia on exam. Still, hernia repair is often done prophylactically during orchiopexy.  \n- Orchiopexy with biopsy (Option D) is not routinely done unless there is suspicion of malignancy or abnormal testicular tissue.\n\nStep 4: Choose the best option  \nGiven the palpable testis at the pubic tubercle and no hernia, the standard approach is orchiopexy with exploration of the inguinal canal, which usually includes hernia sac ligation if found.

The fracture results in a displacement of the bone fragment, leading to a characteristic \"dinner fork\" deformity.\n\n2. **Complications**:\n   - **A. Malunion**: This refers to the improper healing of the bone, resulting in a deformity. While it's a possible complication, the frequency and impact vary.\n   - **B. Avascular Necrosis**: This is a complication that can occur if the blood supply to the bone is compromised. However, it's not the most common complication associated with Colles' fracture.\n   - **C. Finger Stiffness**: Stiffness in the fingers is a common issue following a Colles' fracture, largely due to immobilization and swelling. Early mobilization is often recommended to mitigate this.\n   - **D. Rupture of EPL Tendon**: The Extensor Pollicis Longus (EPL) tendon can rupture after a Colles' fracture, but this is less common compared to some other complications.\n\nConsidering the above, the most common complication is related to the immobilization and the healing process. **Finger stiffness (C)** is a very common complication due to the swelling and immobilization that often accompany the fracture and its treatment. While malunion and other complications can occur, finger stiffness is frequently observed and is a significant concern for functional recovery.\n\nANSWER: C",

It is a useful indicator of left ventricular function and fluid status.\n\n2. **Normal PCWP Values**: Normally, the PCWP ranges from 6 to 12 mmHg. Values within this range suggest that the left side of the heart is functioning properly and that there is no significant fluid overload.\n\n3. **Pulmonary Edema and PCWP**: Pulmonary edema, characterized by fluid accumulation in the lungs, often results from elevated pressures in the left side of the heart (left heart failure). When the left heart cannot efficiently pump blood out of the lungs, pressure builds up, causing fluid to leak into the alveoli and interstitial spaces of the lungs.\n\n4. **PCWP Threshold for Pulmonary Edema**: A commonly accepted threshold for the development of pulmonary edema is a PCWP greater than 18-20 mmHg, but it can occur at lower pressures if the onset is acute or if there are significant changes in vascular permeability.

It can cause raised intraocular pressure (IOP) due to trabeculitis or secondary angle closure.\n\nStep 2: Consider the treatment options  \n- Timolol: A beta-blocker that lowers IOP by decreasing aqueous humor production.  \n- Atropine: A cycloplegic that dilates the pupil and paralyzes accommodation; it can increase IOP by causing angle closure in susceptible eyes.  \n- Pilocarpine: A miotic that constricts the pupil and opens the trabecular meshwork but is contraindicated in uveitis because it can worsen inflammation and cause synechiae.  \n- Steroid: Reduces inflammation but may increase IOP in steroid responders; however, controlling inflammation is crucial in uveitis.\n\nStep 3: Best management approach  \nIn uveitis with raised IOP, controlling inflammation is primary, so steroids are essential. To lower IOP acutely, timolol is safe and effective. Atropine is used to prevent synechiae but can raise IOP, so it must be used cautiously. Pilocarpine is contraindicated.\n\nSince the question asks for the best management of uveitis with raised IOP, the priority is to reduce inflammation (steroids) and lower IOP safely (timolol). Among the options, steroids address the root cause, and timolol addresses raised IOP.
