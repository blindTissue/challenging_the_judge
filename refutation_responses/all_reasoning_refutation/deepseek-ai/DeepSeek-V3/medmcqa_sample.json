Activities that involve sudden stops, pivoting, or downhill walking (which stresses the ACL due to the forward shift of the tibia) are particularly challenging for ACL-deficient knees.\n\n2. **Walk downhill (A)**: This activity requires the ACL to resist the forward sliding of the tibia as the knee flexes and bears weight. An ACL-deficient knee would struggle with this control, making walking downhill difficult and unstable.\n\n3. **Walk uphill (B)**: This primarily engages the quadriceps and requires less ACL stabilization compared to downhill walking, as the tibia is less likely to translate anteriorly.\n\n4. **Sit cross leg (C)**: This involves external rotation and flexion of the knee, but the ACL is not the primary stabilizer here, so it is less affected.\n\n5. **Getting up from sitting (D)**: While this requires knee extension, the ACL is not heavily loaded unless there is a pivot or twist, which is not inherent to this movement.\n\nThe most challenging activity for an ACL-deficient knee is **walking downhill**, as it places significant stress on the ACL's stabilizing function.\n\nANSWER: A",

It is caused by high-impact trauma, such as a blow to the forehead or occiput, which forces the skull to \"hinge\" open along its base.\n\n2. **Location of hinge fractures:**  \n   Hinge fractures are **not** seen in the vault (A) or the individual cranial fossae (B, C, D).

Pleomorphic adenomas most commonly occur in the **parotid gland** (the major salivary gland), not the minor salivary glands of the lips, tongue, or palate. While they can occur in minor salivary glands, the parotid is the most frequent site.\n\n**Option B: They grow rapidly**  \nThis is incorrect. Pleomorphic adenomas are typically **slow-growing** tumors. Rapid growth is more suggestive of malignant tumors, such as mucoepidermoid carcinoma or adenoid cystic carcinoma.\n\n**Option C: They rarely recur if simply enucleated**  \nThis is incorrect. Pleomorphic adenomas have a **high recurrence rate** if they are simply enucleated because the tumor often has microscopic extensions beyond the apparent capsule. The standard treatment is surgical excision with a margin of normal tissue to minimize recurrence.\n\n**Option D: They present as rock-hard masses**  \nThis is incorrect.

A rock-hard mass is more indicative of a malignant tumor or other pathology.\n\nThe question asks for the **characteristic** feature of pleomorphic adenomas, but none of the options provided are entirely accurate.

It is a nonspecific sign but is particularly associated with conditions that cause severe inflammation or necrosis of the bowel wall, leading to a loss of peristalsis.\n\n2. **Option A: Acute pancreatitis**  \n   While acute pancreatitis can cause ileus, it typically presents with a **sentinel loop** (localized ileus) or **colon cutoff sign**, not a generalized gasless abdomen. This makes it less likely.\n\n3. **Option B: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)**  \n   NEC is a life-threatening condition seen primarily in premature infants, characterized by necrosis of the bowel wall. A gasless abdomen on X-ray is a classic finding in advanced NEC due to the loss of bowel motility and pneumatosis intestinalis (though pneumatosis is more specific). This fits well.\n\n4. **Option C: Ulcerative colitis**  \n   Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease affecting the colon. It does not typically cause a gasless abdomen on X-ray. Instead, you might see **thumbprinting** or **toxic megacolon** in severe cases.\n\n5. **Option D: Intussusception**  \n   Intussusception is a mechanical obstruction where one segment of bowel telescopes into another.

Class II elastics run from the upper canine (or first molar) to the lower molar, exerting a force that moves the upper teeth posteriorly and the lower teeth anteriorly.\n\n2. **Key Point**: The question asks about the **type of anchorage** provided by the elastics. Anchorage refers to the resistance to unwanted tooth movement. Class II elastics utilize teeth in one arch to anchor and move teeth in the opposing arch. \n\n3. **Options**:\n   - **A. Intramaxillary anchorage**: This involves anchorage within the same arch (e.g., using some teeth in the upper arch to move other teeth in the upper arch). Class II elastics are **intermaxillary** (between arches), so this is incorrect.\n   - **B. Baker’s anchorage**: This is not a standard term in orthodontics and is irrelevant here.\n   - **C. Moyer’s anchorage**: This refers to a specific technique involving differential anchorage in the same arch, which is not applicable here.\n   - **D. Absolute anchorage**: This implies complete resistance to movement (e.g., using implants or TADs), which is not the case with Class II elastics, as they allow reciprocal movement of teeth in both arches.\n\n4. **Correct Concept**: Class II elastics provide **intermaxillary anchorage**, where teeth in one arch are used to move teeth in the opposing arch. While this term isn’t listed, the closest standard option is **Intramaxillary anchorage (A)**, but it’s technically incorrect.
