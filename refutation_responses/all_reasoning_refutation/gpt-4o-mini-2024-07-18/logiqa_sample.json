If Xiaoming does not go, then neither Xiaohong nor Xiaoqing will go.  \nCounterexample: Xiaoming does not go, but Xiaohong goes, Xiaoqing does not go. The original statement doesn't restrict Xiaohong or Xiaoqing from going if Xiaoming doesn't go.  \n**Conclusion:** Not necessarily true.\n\n**Summary:** None of the options must be true based solely on the original statement.\n\nANSWER: None of the options are necessarily true. However, since the question asks which options must be true, the correct answer is that none do. But as per the multiple-choice format, the best choice is that none of the options are guaranteed.\n\n**Final answer:** The question seems to imply selecting the options that must be true, but none are necessarily true.

The passage suggests that while IQ scores may indicate certain cognitive abilities, they do not equate to wisdom or the ability to navigate social and environmental contexts effectively. \n\n1. **Option A** states that although Chinese have a high IQ, they are not wise. This aligns with the idea presented by Song Jian that IQ is not the same as wisdom, but it generalizes negatively about Chinese people without sufficient evidence from the text.\n\n2. **Option B** claims that Americans have wisdom even though they have lower IQs. This is a possible interpretation of the text, as it suggests that wisdom can exist independently of IQ scores.\n\n3. **Option C** states that IQ does not determine intelligence. This is a broader claim that aligns with the idea that IQ is not synonymous with wisdom, but it does not directly address the relationship between IQ and wisdom as discussed in the passage.\n\n4. **Option D** simply states \"Great wisdom,\" which does not provide a clear argument or connection to the text.\n\nGiven the context, **Option C** is the most accurate because it encapsulates the idea that IQ is not the sole determinant of intelligence, which includes wisdom and other forms of understanding.\n\nANSWER: C",

According to Prospect Theory, most people prefer the sure gain (A) due to risk aversion when facing potential gains. This aligns with the theory.\n\nB. This option compares a sure outcome (saving 200 people) with a risky option (one-third chance to save 600 people). People tend to prefer the sure outcome (X) over the risky one (Y), which is consistent with the risk aversion principle in gains. This also aligns with Prospect Theory.\n\nC. This option suggests that if you have several good news items, you should present them together. This does not directly relate to the principles of Prospect Theory, which focuses on decision-making under risk and uncertainty rather than the presentation of information. Therefore, it does not fit the theory.\n\nD. This option describes a fee structure based on performance, which does not directly relate to the risk preferences outlined in Prospect Theory. However, it does not contradict the theory's principles.\n\nBased on this analysis, option C is the only one that does not fit within the framework of Prospect Theory, as it does not involve decision-making under risk or uncertainty.\n\nANSWER: C",

In the face of this situation, the London government began to charge congestion fees for motor vehicles. It costs ꠸ per vehicle. For the first time, the congestion in London streets has improved, but over time, the congestion has rebounded. Soon, the congestion has reached a maximum, and the speed of London driving can only be 8 mph. It turns out that before charging congestion fees, many private car owners felt that the city's congestion also had its own responsibility, and unconsciously produced a \"guilt\", thereby intentionally or unintentionally reducing the time spent driving. However, when they paid After the ꠸ congestion fee, I thought that I had paid the price for \"mistakes\", and that driving trips were straightforward and without guilt. In many cases, we always want the other person to pay for the mistakes made by others. But Sometimes, the best way is to tolerate or even \"allow\" his mistakes.

The report mentions the poverty rate for 1983 but does not provide historical data to support a steady increase over 18 years. Therefore, this conclusion cannot be drawn.\n\n2. **Option B** suggests that if the effects of the recession continue, the national poverty rate will rise. While the report indicates that the recession had lasting effects, it does not definitively state that the poverty rate will rise as a result. This conclusion is speculative and not directly supported by the information given.\n\n3. **Option C** states that even if some households have not increased their income, the median household income may still increase. This aligns with the report's findings that middle-income household income increased by 1.6% despite the poverty rate remaining high. This conclusion is valid because median income can rise even if some households do not see income growth.\n\n4. **Option D** claims that middle-income income is more affected by changes in family patterns than by the economic conditions. The report does mention the increase in households supported by women and adults not living with relatives, but it does not provide enough evidence to conclude that these changes have a greater impact than economic conditions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most supported conclusion from the report is Option C.\n\nANSWER: C",

Some experts believe that \"tax-price linkage\" will increase the price of cigarettes with the tax rate. When it is increased, the number of people who buy cigarettes will be reduced.

This would weaken the conclusion because it implies that even with a higher tax and price, consumption would not decrease.\n\n2. **Option B**: Increased income levels making people less sensitive to price indicates that as people earn more, they may continue to buy cigarettes despite price increases. This also weakens the conclusion but is less direct than Option A.\n\n3. **Option C**: The fact that the tobacco excise tax rate in most countries is less than 11% does not directly address the relationship between price and consumption in the context of the specific country in question. It does not weaken the conclusion effectively.\n\n4. **Option D**: The proliferation of private cigarettes in developed countries after increasing taxes suggests that people may find alternatives to taxed cigarettes, but it does not directly weaken the conclusion about the overall effect of the tax increase on consumption.\n\nGiven this analysis, **Option A** most directly weakens the conclusion by stating that price changes do not affect output, implying that consumption will remain unchanged despite the tax increase.\n\nANSWER: A",

Condition (2) suggests that if C is chosen (because D is chosen), D is the one that violates \"at most one of C or D,\" implying a potential contradiction if we consider C and D as the \"two members.\" However, the critical insight comes from understanding that the group must include A, B, C, and D, and condition (2) might be referring to a different pairing or is a constraint that needs to be satisfied alongside others.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the conditions again with a focus on the \"at most one\" condition.\nIf \"the two members\" in condition (2) refers to a different pair, such as A and B, or C and D, or any other pair, we need to identify a person who is unlikely to be selected.

Instead of following the order, he chooses to continue fighting, which ultimately leads to victory. This indicates a theme of defiance against orders in favor of achieving a greater goal.\n\n2. Now, let's evaluate the options:\n- **A** suggests that the passage emphasizes discipline and criticizes Nelson for not following orders. This contradicts the overall message of the passage, which highlights his success despite disobeying orders.\n- **B** implies that Nelson's decision was based on assessing the situation. While he did assess the situation, the passage focuses more on his choice to ignore the order rather than a careful evaluation.\n- **C** states that Nelson's victory was a miracle due to the retreat signal. While the signal is mentioned, the passage does not frame the victory as miraculous but rather as a result of Nelson's decision to continue fighting.\n- **D** accurately reflects the passage's focus on how Nelson found a reason to disregard superior orders during the battle, emphasizing his defiance and the resulting victory.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best answer is D, as it captures the essence of Nelson's actions and the theme of the passage.\n\nANSWER: D",

The average weight loss for all participants is 10 kg, with males averaging 14 kg and females averaging 8 kg. This indicates that the male participants lost more weight on average than female participants.\n\n2. For the overall average to be 10 kg, the number of male and female participants must be such that their combined average results in this figure. If there were more males than females, the overall average would be skewed higher, and if there were more females, it would skew lower.\n\n3. The average weight loss of males (14 kg) is higher than that of females (8 kg). This suggests that if the average for all participants is 10 kg, there must be a balance in the number of participants to achieve this average. \n\n4.

It also highlights that the current practices are mostly in the concept construction phase, suggesting that there is still significant progress needed to fully realize these \"smart cities\" (which aligns with option B).\n3.

If Li Ning is admitted, then Wang Lu must also be admitted. If Li Ning is not admitted, this statement does not provide any information about Wang Lu.\n\n2. **B's Statement**: \"I don't think anyone in this class can be admitted to Peking University.\" If B is correct, then both Li Ning and Wang Lu are not admitted.\n\n3. **C's Statement**: \"No matter whether Wang Lu can be admitted to Peking University, Li Ning cannot be admitted to Peking University.\" This means that regardless of Wang Lu's admission status, Li Ning is definitely not admitted.\n\n4. **D's Statement**: \"Wang Lu was admitted to Peking University.\" If D is correct, then Wang Lu is admitted, which contradicts B's statement.\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications of each teacher being correct:\n\n- If **A** is correct, then if Li Ning is admitted, Wang Lu must also be admitted. This creates a scenario where both could be admitted, which contradicts B's statement. Therefore, A cannot be the only one correct.\n\n- If **B** is correct, then neither Li Ning nor Wang Lu is admitted. This would make C's statement also correct (since if neither is admitted, Li Ning cannot be admitted), which contradicts the condition that only one teacher is correct. Therefore, B cannot be the only one correct.\n\n- If **C** is correct, then Li Ning is definitely not admitted, regardless of Wang Lu's status. This does not contradict A or D directly, but it does mean that if C is correct, A and B cannot be correct. If Wang Lu is admitted (D's statement), then A's statement would also be correct, which again contradicts the condition. Therefore, C cannot be the only one correct.\n\n- If **D** is correct, then Wang Lu is admitted. This means A's statement could be true if Li Ning is also admitted, but that would contradict B's statement. If C is correct, then Li Ning cannot be admitted, which would mean A is also incorrect. Thus, D being correct does not lead to contradictions.\n\nGiven that only one teacher can be correct, the only scenario that fits is that **C** is correct (Li Ning cannot be admitted), which means **B** must be incorrect (since he claims no one can be admitted), and **D** must also be incorrect (since Wang Lu cannot be admitted if Li Ning is not). \n\nThus, the conclusion is that **Li Ning was not admitted to Peking University**.\n\nANSWER: B",

This is incorrect because while hydrogen is the lightest and most abundant element, helium is also a primary component of the early universe. Therefore, this statement is too restrictive.\n\n2. **Option B** suggests that some planets were formed before the universe reached two billion years of age. The question states that the universe does not exceed two billion years, but it also mentions gas clouds containing carbon elements that are billions of years old. This implies that some matter (like gas clouds) existed before the formation of planets, but it does not confirm that planets themselves formed before the two billion-year mark.\n\n3. **Option C** claims that the carbon in the gas cloud later formed some parts of the planet. This is plausible because carbon can be formed in stars and dispersed into space, eventually contributing to the formation of planets. This aligns with the idea that heavier elements like carbon can exist in gas clouds and later be incorporated into planetary bodies.\n\n4. **Option D** states that the planet that determines the time is not the same as the gas cloud.
