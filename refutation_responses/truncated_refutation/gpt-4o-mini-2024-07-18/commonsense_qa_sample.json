The phrase \"Brenda spent a lot of effort on washing herself\" suggests that she is concerned about her cleanliness. The options provided relate to the concept of being unclean or dirty.\n\n- A. \"get messy\" - This is not a grammatically correct phrase in this context.\n- B. \"cleaning\" - While she may dislike cleaning, the sentence focuses on her personal hygiene rather than the act of cleaning itself.\n- C. \"get dirty\" - This is also not grammatically correct in this context.\n- D. \"getting dirty\" - This is a valid option, indicating a dislike for the process of becoming dirty.\n- E. \"being dirty\" - This option suggests a dislike for the state of being dirty, which aligns well with her effort in washing herself.\n\nBoth D and E are reasonable, but \"being dirty\" (E) captures the ongoing state she dislikes, while \"getting dirty\" (D) refers to the action that leads to that state. Since the sentence emphasizes her effort in washing, it implies she dislikes the state of being dirty more than the action of becoming dirty.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is E.\n\nANSWER: E",

While some people may have fun while drinking, it is not a guaranteed outcome and can vary by individual. Options C (active) and D (frequent urination) are not direct consequences of excessive drinking, although frequent urination can occur due to alcohol's diuretic effect. However, the most immediate and recognizable effect of excessive alcohol consumption is becoming drunk. Additionally, option E (sickness) can also occur, but it is more of a consequence of overindulgence rather than a direct result like becoming drunk.\n\n2.
