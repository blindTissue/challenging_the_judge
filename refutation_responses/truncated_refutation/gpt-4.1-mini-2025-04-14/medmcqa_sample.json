A blocked salivary duct can lead to increased serum amylase levels due to impaired secretion and subsequent leakage into the bloodstream. This is a valid cause of elevated amylase.\n\n2. **Ruptured ectopic (B)**: A ruptured ectopic pregnancy can cause peritoneal irritation, which may lead to secondary inflammation of the pancreas or other organs, potentially raising amylase levels. While not the most common cause, it is still a possible explanation for elevated amylase.\n\n3. **Appendicitis (C)**: Appendicitis typically does not cause elevated serum amylase levels. Amylase is not produced in the appendix, and appendicitis does not directly affect the pancreas or salivary glands. Therefore, this is the least likely cause of raised amylase among the options.\n\n4. **Pancreatitis (D)**: Pancreatitis is a classic cause of elevated serum amylase because the enzyme is released into the bloodstream due to pancreatic inflammation and damage.
