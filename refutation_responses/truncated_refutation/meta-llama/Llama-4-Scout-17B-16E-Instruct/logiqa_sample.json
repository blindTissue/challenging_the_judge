Unmarried cohabitation. - This was historically considered deviant but has become more accepted over time. It can be seen as challenging traditional norms around marriage and relationships, potentially playing a role in social development by pushing for changes in social attitudes.\n\nC. Refusal of parental support at the age of 14. - This is more of a negative deviance as it can lead to harm and doesn't contribute positively to social development.\n\nD. Use of nude models in art teaching. - This challenges traditional norms around nudity and public decency but can be seen as contributing positively to social development by promoting art, education, and potentially reevaluating societal norms around the human body.\n\nGiven the definition of positive social deviance as behaviors that break with tradition and promote social development, both B and D could fit.

Normally, as household income rises, the number of poor will decrease. However, the national poverty rate in 1983 was 18 years The Census Division provided two possible reasons: the deep, long-lasting effects of the 1981-1982 recession; the number of households supported by women and the number of adults not living with relatives Increase, and both are poorer than the entire population. Which of the following conclusions can be drawn from this report?",
        "answer": "C",
        "choices": [
            "the national poverty rate has been steadily increasing for 18 years.",
            "if the early economic recession still brings continuous effects, the national poverty rate will rise.",

        ],
        "response": "To approach this question, let's analyze the information provided and evaluate each option based on that information.\n\n1. **Understanding the given information:**\n   - Middle-income household income increased by 1.6% in 1983 compared to 1982 after deducting inflation.\n   - Despite this increase, the national poverty rate in 1983 was higher than it had been for 18 years.\n   - Two reasons are given for the high poverty rate: the lingering effects of the 1981-1982 recession and changes in household structures (more households supported by women and more adults not living with relatives, both of which are poorer than the average population).\n\n2. **Evaluating option A:**\n   - The report does not indicate that the national poverty rate has been steadily increasing for 18 years. It only mentions that the poverty rate in 1983 was higher than it had been for 18 years, which does not necessarily imply a steady increase over those 18 years.\n   \n3. **Evaluating option B:**\n   - The report suggests that the lingering effects of the 1981-1982 recession contributed to the high poverty rate in 1983. This implies that if there are still effects from an economic recession, the national poverty rate could indeed be affected, potentially rising.\n\n4. **Evaluating option C:**\n   - The information provided does not directly address how changes in household income across the population affect the median household income. However, it's a general statistical principle that median income can increase even if not all households increase their income, as long as the increases in higher incomes outweigh the decreases or stagnation in lower incomes.\n\n5. **Evaluating option D:**\n   - The report does not provide a direct comparison of the impact of changes in family patterns versus economic expansion or decline on middle-income households. It discusses the poverty rate and reasons for its level but does not make a broad statement about the relative impacts on middle-income households.\n\n**Reasoning Conclusion:**\n- Option A is incorrect because the report does not state the poverty rate has been steadily increasing.\n- Option B seems plausible given the mention of recession effects.\n- Option C is generally true based on statistical principles and aligns with the scenario described.\n- Option D is not directly supported by the information provided.\n\nGiven the information and focusing on what can be directly concluded:\n- The best-supported conclusion is **C**, as it aligns with general principles of statistics and does not require assumptions beyond what is provided.\n\nANSWER: C",

Option A claims a steady increase over 18 years, but the information doesn't specify a trend over that entire period, only that the rate was 18 years at that point.  \nOption B suggests that ongoing effects of the recession could cause the poverty rate to rise, which aligns with the idea that recession effects persist and influence poverty.  \nOption C states that median income can increase even if some households' incomes fall, which is consistent with the concept that median measures central tendency and can rise even if some groups are poorer.  \nOption D claims middle-income is more affected by family patterns than the economy, but the report emphasizes recession effects and family structure as reasons for persistent poverty, not necessarily that middle-income is more affected than overall economic conditions.\n\n3.

However, considering the logic and usual interpretation of such statements, \n\nA seems like a strong candidate because if Lincoln's statement is about the nature of deception in general, saying \"Lincoln may not be deceived at any time\" assumes a specific case (Lincoln) rather than a general rule. \n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, \n\nC. \"There is no one at all times\" seems nonsensical or irrelevant as it does not clearly relate to the possibility of deception across all people and times.\n\nGiven Lincoln's assertion that it is impossible to deceive all people at all times, \n\nA. \"Lincoln may not be deceived at any time\" could actually be seen as not necessarily false based on the information given. \n\nB, C, and D seem less directly contradictory when considering standard interpretations of such statements.\n\nBut if we strictly interpret and evaluate based on standard logic:\n\nThe assertion that **must be** considered in the context of being directly supported or refuted by Lincoln's quote would make \n\n**A** potentially suspect because it makes a claim about a specific individual (Lincoln) not being deceived, which isn't directly addressed by Lincoln's general claim.\n\nHowever, **the real issue** here seems to be about logical deductions and how one interprets \"at all times\" and \"all people.\"\n\nGiven standard logic and understanding:\n\nANSWER: C",

It also mentions that mutations can occur under normal conditions during DNA replication, albeit at a low frequency.\n\n2. **Identifying Key Points**:\n   - DNA's molecular structure is not static.\n   - Genetic mutations can occur due to physical, chemical, or environmental factors.\n   - Mutations can also occur under normal conditions during DNA replication.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - **A. DNA molecular structure is highly variable.** While the passage does indicate that DNA's structure is not static, it doesn't directly imply that the structure is \"highly variable\" in a general sense. It focuses more on the potential for change (mutation) rather than the degree of variability.\n   - **B. DNA may be mutated.** This option directly aligns with the information provided in the passage. It states that under various influences, the genetic code of DNA may change, causing mutations.\n   - **C. DNA is very prone to genetic mutations.** The passage does not suggest that DNA is \"very prone\" to mutations. It mentions that under normal conditions, mutations occur at an \"extremely low frequency,\" which contradicts the idea that DNA is very prone to mutations.\n   - **D. DNA variation is possible only in special cases.** The passage indicates that mutations can occur under normal conditions (not just special cases) and due to various factors, making this statement too restrictive.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The passage primarily supports the idea that DNA can undergo mutations due to various factors and even under normal conditions, without implying that DNA is highly variable, very prone to mutations, or that variation only occurs in special cases.\n\nANSWER: B",

        ],
        "response": "To determine which option does not fit the prospect theory, let's analyze each option in the context of the theory:\n\n## Step 1: Understanding Prospect Theory\nProspect theory, proposed by Daniel Kahneman, suggests that people are risk-averse when facing gains and risk-prone when facing losses. Additionally, it states that people are more sensitive to losses than to gains.\n\n## 2: Analyzing Option A\nOption A presents a sure gain of 1,000 yuan versus a 50% chance to win 2,000 yuan and a 50% chance to win nothing. Most people are risk-averse for gains, so they prefer a sure gain (A) over a gamble with the same expected value but higher risk. This fits the prospect theory.\n\n## 3: Analyzing Option B\nOption B discusses two plans: one that surely saves 200 people and another that has a one-third chance to save 600 people and a two-thirds chance that none will be saved. The expected value of saving people is higher in plan Y (200 people) than in plan X, but plan X is a sure gain, while plan Y is risky. People preferring plan X are acting in line with being risk-averse for gains, which fits the prospect theory.\n\n## 4: Analyzing Option C\nOption C suggests bundling good news together. Prospect theory implies that people prefer to frame gains positively and losses negatively. Bundling good news could enhance the positive framing of gains, which aligns with prospect theory.\n\n## 5: Analyzing Option D\nOption D describes a fund management fee structure that charges a management fee and a performance reward. The key here is to see if it aligns with loss aversion and risk attitudes described by prospect theory. The structure seems to focus on gains (returns) rather than losses directly, but it frames the performance reward in a way that might not directly relate to the typical examples of prospect theory (like risk aversion for gains and risk-seeking for losses).\n\n## 6: Detailed Examination of Option D\nUpon closer inspection, Option D presents a scenario where the fund manager's fee structure could be seen as framing a \"loss\" (the fee) in a way that is dependent on performance. However, it does not directly test risk aversion for gains or risk-seeking for losses as described by prospect theory. Instead, it describes a common practice in finance.\n\n## 7: Conclusion\nThe prospect theory primarily deals with how people make decisions under risk and their preference for certain outcomes over probabilistic ones, especially concerning gains and losses. Option C, about bundling good news, does not directly relate to the risk attitudes (risk-averse for gains, risk-prone for losses) or the loss aversion aspect of prospect theory as directly as the other options do. However, upon careful consideration, all options seem to relate to aspects of decision-making under uncertainty or framing effects. \n\nBut if we strictly interpret the question and look for what \"does not fit the prospect theory,\" we need to identify a statement that contradicts or does not align with the principles of prospect theory.\n\n## 8: Final Analysis\nOption C talks about presenting good news together, which is more about framing effects and mental accounting rather than directly testing the risk preferences for gains and losses outlined in prospect theory. However, it does not necessarily contradict prospect theory but rather discusses a separate aspect of decision-making.\n\nGiven the context and focusing strictly on risk preferences:\n- A fits as people are risk-averse for gains.\n- B fits as it reflects a preference for a sure gain over a risky one.\n- D, while about fees and performance, doesn't directly contradict but also doesn't neatly fit the simple gain/loss risk preference model.\n\nHowever, considering standard interpretations and implications of prospect theory:\n\nANSWER: C",

People prefer a sure gain (saving 200 people) over a gamble (saving 600 people with 1/3 probability), showing risk aversion. This fits (a) but let's examine the framing.\n- Option C: Suggesting to put good news together implies that people are more sensitive to gains when they are aggregated, which can be related to the theory's aspect that people are more sensitive to losses than gains, and by extension, how they perceive gains.\n- Option D: The fund management company's fee structure is based on the return rate. To assess if it fits the prospect theory, we need to understand if it exploits the biases described by the theory.\n\n## Step 3: Examine each choice to see which one does not fit the \"Prospect Theory\"\n- A fits because it shows risk aversion for gains.\n- B, upon closer inspection, is about gains (lives saved) and shows risk aversion, fitting (a). However, the framing could affect perception; it's still about preferring a sure gain.\n- C suggests aggregating good news, which could be seen as related to how people perceive gains, potentially fitting the theory as it implies a strategy based on how people value gains.\n- D describes a fee structure that charges more when returns are higher. To see if it fits, we need to consider if it relates to risk aversion, risk proneness, or loss aversion.\n\n## Step 4: Determine which option does not fit the \"Prospect Theory\"\nThe \"Prospect Theory\" is about how people make decisions under uncertainty, specifically being risk-averse for gains and risk-seeking for losses, and being more sensitive to losses. Let's directly assess the choices:\n- A and B illustrate risk aversion for gains, fitting the theory.\n- C implies a strategy that could be related to the theory, as it involves the perception of gains.\n- D involves a complex fee structure.

The structure doesn't directly relate to the psychological biases outlined in the \"Prospect Theory\" but rather is a contractual arrangement. However, the theory is about decision-making under uncertainty. The fee structure is more about incentivizing fund managers rather than a direct example of prospect theory in action.\n\n## Step 6: Decide based on the analysis\nGiven that A, B, and C can be related to the principles of \"Prospect Theory\" either by illustrating risk aversion for gains or strategies that could be influenced by the theory's principles, we need to identify which one doesn't fit. D is more about a contractual or business arrangement rather than a direct illustration of the psychological principles outlined by Kahneman.\n\n## Step 7: Conclude\nD is the least directly related to illustrating the principles of \"Prospect Theory\" as it describes a fee structure rather than a decision-making scenario under uncertainty that directly demonstrates risk aversion for gains, risk proneness for losses, or loss aversion.\n\nANSWER: D",

Revolutionary must be good.** The passage does not imply that being revolutionary is inherently good; it merely states that revolutionaries believe change is needed.\n   - **B. Being conservative must be bad.** Similarly, the passage does not suggest that being conservative is inherently bad; it just presents the conservative viewpoint as trying to maintain the current order.\n   - **C. Conservatives generally represent the interests of the majority of the people and are therefore welcomed and supported by those in power.** The passage does not provide information about who conservatives represent or their relationship with those in power.\n   - **D. Which of the two viewpoints, revolution and conservative, is better?** The passage does not evaluate which viewpoint is better; it simply presents them as two different perspectives.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The passage aims to present a neutral view of revolutionaries and conservatives, highlighting their different perspectives without making a value judgment.

It varies with distance from the epicenter.\n\nGiven these definitions:\n\n- **A. The greater the magnitude of the earthquake, the stronger the corresponding intensity of the earthquake.**\n  - This statement is generally true but can be misleading. A larger magnitude earthquake releases more energy and can cause stronger shaking (higher intensity) closer to the epicenter. However, the intensity at a specific location also depends on the distance from the epicenter, not just the magnitude.\n\n- **B. An earthquake has only one magnitude and one intensity.**\n  - This is incorrect. An earthquake has one magnitude but multiple intensities. The intensity varies depending on the location relative to the epicenter.\n\n- **C. The closer to the source, the larger the magnitude and the stronger the intensity.**\n  - This is partially incorrect. The magnitude of an earthquake does not change with distance from the source; it's a constant value for a given earthquake. However, the intensity does indeed tend to be stronger closer to the source.\n\n- **D. The more severe the surface damage, the stronger the earthquake intensity.**\n  - This statement is true.

This option suggests that fires caused by mosquito repellents are less damaging, implying that their reduction wouldn't significantly impact the overall death toll from fires. This could explain the situation.\n\nB. This option implies that fires from mosquito repellents might not be a major contributor to nighttime fatalities since they occur when people are asleep, but it doesn't directly address why the death toll hasn't decreased if other fire causes are more deadly or common.\n\nC. This option suggests that while awareness of one fire hazard (mosquito repellents) has increased, other hazards have been neglected. This could explain why the overall death toll hasn't decreased.\n\nD. This option suggests that even if the specific cause of fires (like mosquito repellents) has decreased, the potential for damage and death from fires has increased due to changes in household items. This could also explain the situation.\n\nThe question asks for the option that does **not** explain the situation. \n\nOption B discusses the nature of when these fires occur but does not directly address why the overall number of deaths from fires hasn't decreased despite a reduction in one potential cause. It hints at a reason (timing of fires) but doesn't provide a direct link to the unchanged death toll as effectively as the other options do in terms of explaining changes in fire hazards, damage potential, or prevention awareness.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, B actually provides a reason that might explain why reducing mosquito repellent use didn't decrease the death toll (since these fires might not contribute heavily to the death toll due to their timing), making it somewhat relevant.\n\nBut if we strictly interpret the question for what does **not** explain the situation given:\n\nA, C, and D all offer plausible reasons for why the death toll hasn't decreased despite reduced mosquito repellent use.\n\nB, however, is more about the characteristics of the fires caused by mosquito repellents rather than a direct explanation for the lack of decrease in the death toll from all fires. \n\nBut given that, \n\nANSWER: B",

This could explain why fire deaths remain unchanged despite fewer Artemisia fires.\n\nOption B: Fires occurring after family members fall asleep could lead to more severe consequences, maintaining the death rate even if Artemisia use declines. This supports the unchanged death rate.\n\nOption C: Increased awareness of Artemisia-related fire prevention but not other causes could mean other fire hazards persist, keeping death rates steady.

Planets could form later, incorporating these elements.\n\n- **B. Some planets were formed before the universe reached two billion years of age.** This seems plausible because if we see carbon in gas clouds billions of years ago, it implies that there were stars (or planets) that exploded and dispersed carbon that early.\n\n- **C.

Expanding investment is reducing the \"rice bowl\" of today's people.** This is contrary to the information provided, which suggests expanding investment increases the \"rice bowl\" for future generations, not reduces it for today's people.\n\n- **B. Compressing investment is good for stability, and expanding investment is good for development.** The paragraph actually implies the opposite regarding stability; compressing investment is not good for long-term stability.\n\n- **C. Expanding investment is conducive to solving employment problems in the long run.** This aligns with the information provided that expanding investment increases the \"rice bowl\" for future generations, implying job creation and solving employment problems.\n\n- **D. Reducing investment is conducive to solving current employment problems.** The paragraph does not support this; reducing (or compressing) investment is linked to suppressing the \"rice bowl,\" which would not help solve employment problems.\n\n**Reasoning**: The paragraph emphasizes the benefits of expanding investment for job creation and long-term stability, suggesting that more investment leads to more employment opportunities, which is crucial for societal stability.\n\n**ANSWER: C**",

However, without knowing Dong's country of origin, we cannot conclusively make this statement. If Dong is from one of the mentioned countries, he could still have been abroad (to another country not listed). This statement might seem plausible but is not necessarily true without more information.\n\n2. **Dong is not a British**: This inference can be considered correct based on the information given. If Dong has not been to the United Kingdom, it doesn't directly imply his nationality, but if we consider the context that he hasn't been to several major countries, it might suggest he's not from the UK, assuming citizens of a country often travel to their own country. However, this is a weak inference without direct information about his nationality or travel habits.\n\n3. **Dong has not been to European and American countries**: This inference seems correct. The countries listed (United States, Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Australia) include major countries in Europe, North America, and Australia/Oceania. If Dong hasn't been to these, it implies he hasn't been to these regions, which are commonly referred to as European and American countries in a broad sense.\n\n4. **Dong does not know many countries**: This inference is subjective and not directly supported by the information given. The list of countries Dong hasn't been to does not necessarily reflect his knowledge of countries.\n\nGiven the information and focusing on the question of which inference is wrong:\n\n- Inference (1) \"Dong has not been abroad\" could be considered wrong or at least not necessarily true because we don't know Dong's country of origin. He could have been to other countries not listed.\n\n- Inference (2) has some basis but is not directly supported.\n\n- Inference (3) seems correct based on the information.\n\n- Inference (4) is subjective and not directly inferable.\n\nThe most clearly wrong or problematic inference based on direct information given and common logical deductions would be:\n\n**Inference (1)**, as it makes an assumption about Dong's travel history outside of the listed countries without sufficient information.\n\n**Inference (4)** seems also problematic as it introduces a subjective judgment not directly supported by the given data.\n\nHowever, focusing strictly on the information given and typical logical deductions:\n\nInference (1) assumes a lot without basis (Dong's origin), and \n\nInference (4) is about knowledge, not directly related to travel.\n\nGiven standard logical deductions and focusing on clear incorrectness based on provided and implied information:\n\nANSWER: D",

This means C could also be true because it says at least one of B and D will play, and since D is playing, C's condition is satisfied.\n\n## 2: Evaluating Combinations\n- If D is true, then for C to be true, it fits because D playing satisfies C. \n- B cannot be true if A is true because they contradict each other directly. \n- If A is true, then no one plays, which contradicts D's statement.\n\n## 3: Checking for Two True and Two False Statements\n- **Scenario with D being true**: If D and C are true, then A and B must be false. A being false means some of them will play (which aligns with D and C being true). B being false means none of them will play, which contradicts D playing.

For A and D to be false, none will play (A false means some will play, so A must be one of the false ones) and D won't play. But if D doesn't play, C being true relies on B playing.

A chemical factory near the river produces this fertilizer, and the number of ovulations in red trout raised by farmers in the watershed has dropped. Therefore, the chemical plant must have polluted the river.\n\nThe error in this argument is assuming that because two events are correlated (or one is a consequence of the other), and a third event occurs which is similar in nature to the second event, the cause of the second event must be the first event.\n\n2. **Analyzing Options**:\n\nA. **Malnutrition is easy to get sick. Lee is very fat but he has no malnutrition after checking various indicators, so he is definitely not easy to get sick.** - This option misinterprets a condition (malnutrition leading to sickness) and applies it incorrectly to conclude about Lee's health based on his not being malnourished.\n\nB. **Severe insomnia often stays up late, Zhang is a university teacher and often stays up to work until two o'clock, so Zhang is likely to be a severe insomniac.** - This assumes a condition (severe insomnia) is present because one of its symptoms (staying up late) is observed.\n\nC. **People who test positive for Helicobacter pylori will get stomach ulcers, and Zhang will have stomach ulcer disease, so Zhang must be positive for H. pylori.** - This assumes a cause (H. pylori) for an effect (stomach ulcers) without considering other possible causes for the effect.\n\nD. **People who eat fatty meat can cause an increase in the incidence of cardiovascular disease.

In the face of this situation, the London government began to charge congestion fees for motor vehicles. It costs ꠸ per vehicle. For the first time, the congestion in London streets has improved, but over time, the congestion has rebounded. Soon, the congestion has reached a maximum, and the speed of London driving can only be 8 mph. It turns out that before charging congestion fees, many private car owners felt that the city's congestion also had its own responsibility, and unconsciously produced a \"guilt\", thereby intentionally or unintentionally reducing the time spent driving. However, when they paid After the ꠸ congestion fee, I thought that I had paid the price for \"mistakes\", and that driving trips were straightforward and without guilt. In many cases, we always want the other person to pay for the mistakes made by others. But Sometimes, the best way is to tolerate or even \"allow\" his mistakes. Only in this way can he feel guilty, so that he can remember this mistake for a long time, and never make the same mistake. What does this text mainly explain?",

Initially, the fee seemed to improve congestion but later led to a rebound in congestion.\n\n2. **Behavioral Change**: Before the congestion fee, private car owners felt a sense of guilt for contributing to congestion and, as a result, reduced their driving time. After the fee was introduced, they felt they had paid for their \"mistakes\" and thus drove more.\n\n3. **Moral Insight**: The text suggests that feeling guilty for one's actions can lead to behavioral change. It implies that by not penalizing individuals directly (in a monetary sense) for their actions, they are more likely to reflect on their behavior and change it.\n\n4. **Main Point**: The main point seems to be about the psychological effect of guilt on behavior and how direct payment for mistakes can negate this effect, leading to a return to previous behaviors.\n\nGiven these points, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **A. Only consider the rules.** This doesn't capture the essence of the text, which discusses the psychological impact of guilt and payment on behavior.\n  \n- **B. The best way to face traffic congestion in London is tolerance.** This aligns with the text's implication that allowing individuals to feel guilty (perhaps through tolerance rather than direct penalty) can lead to better outcomes.\n\n- **C.

However, many people have always been reluctant to accept this view, but Preconceivedly distorted Darwin's theory of evolution as a theory of progress and spread it. According to evolutionary theory, it is difficult to predict the evolutionary trend of a species, because the mechanism of evolution includes two factors-the environments and the species itself. We cannot predict changes in the environment. It is also difficult for us to fully grasp how the species itself inherits and mutates. Evolution theory can only explain to a large extent, rather than accurately predicting it, so it is unreasonable to give the evolutionary trend of species based on evolution theory.

It reflects the optimal use of resources and is calculated to evaluate the economic value of resources when their quantity changes.\n\n2. **Mathematical Basis**: The shadow price is related to the first-order partial derivative of the objective function with respect to the constraints (resources). This indicates a mathematical or quantitative method to derive the shadow price.\n\n3. **Economic Interpretation**: It is used as an economic evaluation of resources, indicating how much the objective function (often representing profit or output) would increase if the amount of a particular resource were increased by a small amount. This implies it's a concept with economic implications.\n\n4. **Relation to Management**: In management, especially in operations research and management science, shadow prices are used to make decisions about resource allocation. They help managers understand the marginal value of resources.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- **A. A mathematical concept**: This is correct because shadow prices are derived using mathematical methods (calculus, linear programming).\n- **B.

Employers do not actually have the right to choose freely.** The passage focuses on employees and their perceptions of choice, not directly on employers' rights to choose.\n   - **D. Society does not provide multiple choices for employees.** This statement can be inferred from the passage, as it implies that despite the illusion of multiple choices, societal or economic pressures lead people to pursue similar paths.\n\n3. **Making the inference**: The passage primarily discusses the illusion of choice among employees and how this leads to a convergence on high-paying jobs.

However, option C directly impacts the interpretation of the results by introducing an additional treatment (drugs) that the walking group received, which could be a significant factor in their improvement.\n\nGiven the need to identify the option that most weakens the argument about the effectiveness of simple and cheap exercises for moderately damaged stroke survivors, option C is particularly compelling because it directly suggests that the improvement in the walking group could be due to more than just exercise.\n\nANSWER: C",

This means different subtypes are predominantly found in different ethnic groups.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Statements**:\n   - **FB subtype is unique to whites**: This implies that primarily, but not exclusively, whites have this subtype. It does not rule out the possibility of others having it, but it's unique or more commonly associated with whites.\n   - **ST subtype is only found in yellow people**: This suggests a strong association of the ST subtype with people of East Asian descent, implying it's less likely or not found in other groups.\n   - **C3 subtype is only found in black people**: Similar to the ST subtype, this indicates a strong association of the C3 subtype with people of African descent.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Options**:\n   - **A. People need to make GM blood type in addition to ABO blood type when transfusion**: The text does not provide information on the necessity of matching GM blood types during transfusions, only that these types exist and have ethnic specificity.\n   - **B. All Africans have the C3 subtype of GM blood type**: The text states the C3 subtype is \"only found in black people,\" which does not necessarily mean all Africans have it, just that it's primarily or exclusively found in this group.\n   - **C. People with GM blood type FB subtype will not be yellow**: Given that the FB subtype is unique to whites, it suggests that individuals with this subtype are less likely to be of East Asian descent (referred to as \"yellow people\" here), but it does not categorically exclude the possibility.\n   - **D. Some whites can also have the ST subtype of GM blood type**: The text states the ST subtype is \"only found in yellow people,\" which implies it's not typically found in whites.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The statement that **\"FB subtype like the GM blood type is unique to whites\"** and **\"ST subtype is only found in yellow people; C3 subtype is only found in black people\"** suggests ethnic specificity but does not rule out exceptions entirely.\n   - **Option D** seems plausible because while ethnic specificities are mentioned, genetic variations can lead to exceptions.\n\n**Given the specificity and implications of the statements:**\n\n- The text implies associations rather than absolute exclusivities, which might suggest exceptions.\n\n**ANSWER: D**",

The text does not explicitly state that Xiao Liu was never late, only that he still got the bonus.\n\n- **B.

People who are late are not regular employees of the company.** This option does not logically follow from the information provided. The policy and its consequences apply to employees in general, without specifying different categories of employees.\n\nThe key piece of information is that despite some employees being late, Xiao Liu still got the bonus.

The fact that Xiao Liu kept his bonus implies that either he was not late, or the condition for losing the bonus (someone being late) was avoided in a way that didn't apply to him specifically, or the policy was not universally applied as described.\n\nHowever, given that **some employees were late** and the condition for deducting the bonus is that **someone** is late (implying a collective penalty), the most straightforward inference is that Xiao Liu's situation (getting the bonus) contrasts with what would happen if the penalty were applied across the board.\n\nThe best-supported inference, given that some employees were late and assuming the policy was in effect, is that:\n\n**If all employees were subject to the policy and some were late, but Xiao Liu got his bonus, it suggests that either Xiao Liu wasn't late or there's an exception not fully detailed.

This is an example of **stimulus generalization** because the fear response generalizes from snakes to similar stimuli (ropes). So, this statement seems correct regarding stimulus generalization.\n\nB. \"Looking horizontally into a ridge and a peak, with different heights and distances\" could imply learning to differentiate between similar but distinct visual stimuli (like a ridge and a peak), which aligns with **stimulus differentiation**. This seems correct.\n\nC. A manufacturer designing unique packaging to make customers differentiate their product is an example of **stimulus differentiation**. The goal is to make the product stand out and be recognized differently from similar products, which seems correct.\n\nD. After a brand of toothpaste becomes famous, the manufacturer names its cosmetics under the same brand to leverage the positive recognition of the toothpaste brand. This is an attempt to generalize the positive perception of the toothpaste brand to other products (cosmetics) under the same brand name, which is an example of **stimulus generalization**.

If true, it implies a dependency of the rhododendrons on the warblers, which could suggest that the increase in rhododendrons might affect the warblers negatively. This weakens the conclusion.\n\nC. This option indicates that both species feed on forest pests but not on each other's main food. This suggests some competition for food resources, but it does not directly link the decrease in willow warblers to the increase in rhododendrons, so it does not effectively weaken the conclusion.\n\nD. This option states that baby rhododendrons can only hatch in willow warbler nests. This implies a direct dependency of rhododendrons on willow warblers for reproduction, which would suggest that the increase in rhododendrons could be affecting the warblers negatively.

        ],
        "response": "To approach this question, let's analyze the information provided and the options given:\n\n1. **Understanding the premise**: The question explains that future outer sheaths of deep-sea cables might be made of glass instead of metal (like steel or aluminum alloy) because metals have a granular microstructure. This microstructure makes them prone to breaking under deep-sea pressure, especially at particle boundaries. Glass, despite appearing solid, can flow under pressure and is considered a liquid in this context.\n\n2. **Analyzing the options**:\n   - **A. All so-called solids can be considered as slow-flowing liquids.** This statement is broadly related to the concept that the distinction between solids and liquids can sometimes be blurry, especially under certain conditions (like high pressure or over long periods). However, it generalizes a property of glass (that it flows under pressure) to all solids, which isn't necessarily accurate or directly supported by the given context.\n   - **B. Glass is more suitable as a building material than steel or aluminum alloy.** The passage suggests glass might be more suitable for deep-sea cable sheaths due to its properties under pressure, but it doesn't broadly claim glass is more suitable than steel or aluminum alloy for all building materials.\n   - **C. Liquid has no granular microstructure.** This statement seems to address the difference between the microstructure of metals (described as having a granular microstructure) and that of materials considered liquids (like glass under certain conditions). However, it doesn't directly relate to why glass would be preferred for deep-sea applications.\n   - **D. In future deep-sea operations, FRP will replace metals and play a greater role.** The passage does not mention FRP (Fiber-Reinforced Polymer) at all. It discusses the potential use of glass versus metal for cable sheaths.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The passage specifically discusses the properties of glass and metals under deep-sea pressure and does not provide information that directly supports options A, B, or D.

        "response": "To determine which of the following are self-righteous according to the given definition, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. See Xiansi Qi. - This option seems to imply seeing or admiring others (Xiansi Qi could be interpreted as looking up to or emulating virtuous or superior individuals). This aligns with the first type of self-righteousness mentioned: imitating others.\n\nB. There is Hongru in-jokes, and there is no ding. - This option seems unclear or possibly mistranslated. However, if it implies associating with or claiming connection to something prestigious or honorable (Hongru could imply a noble or virtuous person), it could relate to using others' advantages or honors to satisfy one's wishes.\n\nC. People and Clouds. - This option is vague but could imply following or admiring people (and possibly their attributes or achievements, \"Clouds\" could metaphorically represent lofty or admirable qualities). This could align with imitating others.\n\nD. Full loss, Qian benefits. - This seems to imply gaining benefits at the expense of others or losing something (possibly integrity) for personal gain. While it suggests an imbalance, it doesn't directly align with the definitions provided for self-righteousness.\n\nGiven the definitions:\n- Imitating others.\n- Using the advantages, honors, etc., of others to satisfy their wishes.\n\nOptions A, B, and C seem to relate more directly to the concept of self-righteousness as defined.

The conditions imply: (1) A or B (or both) must be in; (2) either C or D (or neither) can be in, but not both; (3) if D (Ding) is in, then C and E must be in.\n\n## Step 3: Analyze condition (3) and its implications.\nIf D (Ding) is selected, C and E must be selected. This means D and C cannot both be selected under condition (2) if we are to satisfy both conditions (2) and (3) without contradiction, unless the \"at most one\" condition refers to a different pair.\n\n## Step 4: Re-evaluate the conditions with the given options.\nGiven the conditions and the fact that the group must include the four mentioned (A, B, C, D), let's directly assess the options with the understanding that A and B are musts due to condition (1) and the fact that they are among the four.\n\n## Step 5: Assess the possibility of each given choice being unlikely to be selected.\n- A: A must be selected due to condition (1).\n- B: Similarly, B is not necessarily always selected if A is, but at least one of them must be.\n- C: Ding (D) being selected implies C is selected. If C is not selected, D cannot be selected due to condition (3).\n- D: C's selection is dependent on other conditions, especially if D is selected.\n\n## Step 6: Determine the least likely person to be selected based on the given conditions.\nIf D (Ding) is chosen, C and E are chosen. This satisfies condition (3). Condition (2) suggests that if C is chosen (because D is chosen), D is the one that violates \"at most one of C or D,\" implying a potential contradiction if we consider C and D as the \"two members.\" However, the critical insight comes from understanding that the group must include A, B, C, and D, and condition (2) might be referring to a different pairing or is a constraint that needs to be satisfied alongside others.\n\n## Step 7: Analyze the conditions again with a focus on the \"at most one\" condition.\nIf \"the two members\" in condition (2) refers to a different pair, such as A and B, or C and D, or any other pair, we need to identify a person who is unlikely to be selected. Given that A and B must be included, and if we consider C and D as the pair for condition (2), selecting D (Ding) forces C to be selected.\n\n## Step 8: Final analysis based on the given choices.\nSince A and B are musts, they are likely to be selected. If Ding (D) is selected, C and E are selected. The condition that the group includes A, B, C, and D is a given. The \"at most one\" condition is tricky without knowing the exact pair it refers to, but if it refers to C and D, then selecting D forces C to be in, which is a valid scenario.\n\n## Step 9: Consider the implications of each choice.\nB is a possible candidate because if A is selected, B doesn't have to be, satisfying condition (1). However, the question is about who is \"unlikely\" to be selected. Given that A or B must be selected, both are likely. If Ding is selected, C and E are selected, making C likely if Ding is selected.\n\n## Step 10: Conclude based on the conditions and the given options.\nThe question hints at a logical deduction based on the given conditions. Since A and B are musts, and if Ding (let's say D) is chosen, C and E are chosen, we need to find someone who doesn't necessarily fit into a required selection pattern.\n\n## Step 11: Simplify the thought process to directly address the question.\nThe conditions imply certain selections are necessary or likely. A and B are necessary. If D (Ding) is chosen, C and E are necessary. The \"at most one\" condition is key but depends on the pair it refers to.\n\n## Step 12: Directly assess the likelihood of each option being selected.\nGiven the constraints and focusing on the options: A and B are likely due to condition (1). C's selection is tied to D's (Ding's) selection. Thus, we need to think about who is \"unlikely\" to be selected based on the conditions.\n\nThe best answer is B. \nANSWER: B",

This option directly supports the idea that women are promoters of upgrading the consumption structure. It mentions that women have \"higher requirements for the quality of products and services,\" which aligns with the notion of seeking better or more advanced products, thereby driving the upgrade of the consumption structure.\n\nD. This option simply states that there is a large female consumer group in China, which is a fact but does not directly support the idea that women are driving an upgrade in the consumption structure. The size of the group is important, but without information on their consumption habits or preferences, it doesn't directly support the experts' views.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best support for the experts' views is provided by option C, as it directly addresses the nature of women's consumption preferences in a way that aligns with driving an upgrade in the consumption structure.\n\nANSWER: C",

This option includes a wide range of ages with a significant outlier (children under 10 and elderly over 90), which could skew the mean. The presence of extreme values (very young and very old) might not make it ideal.\n\nB. The presence of a company executive with an annual income of more than one million yuan introduces an extreme value that could significantly skew the average annual income of young employees under 35.\n\nC. This option involves counting the average height of young people across different educational levels (preschool, primary school, and secondary school). Although there might be some variation, heights within these age groups tend to be more homogeneous compared to mixing in extreme values, vague data, or very heterogeneous data.\n\nD. Using estimated data for some districts and counties introduces vague data, which, according to the definition, makes the arithmetic mean not suitable.\n\nGiven these considerations, option C seems the most suitable because it involves a relatively homogeneous group (young people in school) without mentioned extreme values, vague data, or heterogeneous data that would skew the mean.\n\nANSWER: C",
