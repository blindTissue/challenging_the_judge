They are native to the tropical regions of Central and South America.\n\n2. **Eliminating Irrelevant Options**:\n   - **A. Texas**: This is a state in the United States, which is outside the typical range of marmosets.\n   - **B. Grassy field**: This describes a type of habitat but is too general and not specific to marmosets' known habitats.\n   - **E. Wilderness**: This term is also too general and can apply to many different types of environments around the world.\n\n3. **Focusing on Relevant Options**:\n   - **C. South and Central America**: This directly matches the known geographical range of marmosets.\n   - **D. American Tropics**: This option also aligns with the known habitat of marmosets, as the American tropics include parts of Central and South America.\n\n4. **Choosing the Best Answer**:\n   - Both **C** and **D** seem correct based on the known habitat of marmosets.

He goes to the couch instead.\n\n2. **Analysis**: Since Sam needs rest but can't sleep, he's looking for an alternative way to unwind or rest without necessarily going to bed.\n\n3. **Option Analysis**:\n   - **A. pig out**: This means to eat a lot, often of unhealthy food. While possible, it doesn't directly relate to resting.\n   - **B. lay down**: This is a plausible action for resting on the couch.\n   - **C. go to bed**: This option is mentioned as something Sam doesn't have time for, making it incorrect.\n   - **D. slow pace**: This phrase doesn't describe an action one would do on the couch but rather a manner of moving or acting.\n   - **E. relax**: This directly relates to resting and is something one can do on the couch.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given that Sam needs to rest but can't sleep, the most appropriate actions would be those that help him unwind or rest without necessarily sleeping. Both \"lay down\" and \"relax\" seem suitable, but \"relax\" is a broader term that encompasses the idea of resting without necessarily lying down (though lying down is a common way to relax).\n\nHowever, considering the context that he \"just went to the couch\" as an alternative to sleeping, the most straightforward and universally applicable action related to resting on the couch would be to \"lay down\" as it directly implies a resting position.\n\nANSWER: B",

The ironing board (A) is where the ironing happens, not where you'd store items afterward. The house (B) is too broad. The kitchen (E) is unlikely as it's not a common place for storing clothes. The laundry room (D) is a plausible place for ironing and could be where you put away clothes, but specifically for storing ironed items, there's a more precise location.\n\n4. **Linen Closet (C)**: This is typically where clothes, especially linens and other garments that are often ironed (like shirts, dresses, etc.), are stored after being cleaned and ironed.\n\nConsidering these steps, the most appropriate place to put something after it has been ironed would be in a linen closet, where such items are usually stored.\n\nANSWER: C",

This immediacy is something that traditional sources like books, manuals, and meetings cannot match.\n\n3. **Usage Statistics and Trends**: Studies and surveys have shown a significant shift towards online sources for information. This includes not just the internet in general (A), but specifically online platforms, news websites, social media, and search engines.\n\n4. **Options Analysis**:\n   - **A. internet**: This is a broad term that encompasses online information sources.\n   - **B. books**: While still a valuable source, books are not as immediate or as frequently used for up-to-date information as online sources.\n   - **C. online**: This is essentially synonymous with the internet and is where most people find information today.\n   - **D. manual**: Manuals are specific to product instructions or technical guides and are not a primary source for general information.\n   - **E. meeting**: Meetings can be a source of information but are not as accessible or as frequently used for information gathering as online sources.\n\nGiven that \"online\" (C) and \"internet\" (A) are very similar and both accurately describe where people find most of their information, the most accurate and encompassing term would be \"internet\" because it is the underlying infrastructure that enables online access.\n\nHowever, considering common phrasing in such questions and the fact that \"online\" directly implies the use of the internet for information, both A and C could seem correct.

        "response": "To approach this question, let's consider what exhaustion means and how it is typically treated, especially in the context of a pregnant woman.\n\n1. **Understanding Exhaustion**: Exhaustion refers to a state of extreme tiredness or fatigue. It's a common condition that can affect anyone, but pregnant women are particularly susceptible due to the physical and emotional changes they are undergoing.\n\n2. **Treatment of Exhaustion**: Generally, the treatment for exhaustion involves rest and stress reduction. The goal is to allow the body and mind to recover.\n\n3. **Pregnancy Considerations**: During pregnancy, it's crucial for the woman's health and the baby's health that she takes care of herself. This includes managing stress and getting adequate rest.\n\nGiven these considerations, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- **A. run out of steam**: This is a phrase that describes becoming exhausted, not a treatment.\n- **B. give birth**: This is not a treatment for exhaustion and is an event that occurs at the end of pregnancy.\n- **C. have rest**: Rest is a general and appropriate treatment for exhaustion.\n- **D. sit down**: While sitting down can provide temporary relief, it's not a comprehensive treatment for exhaustion.\n- **E. stay in bed**: This is a more specific form of rest that could be recommended for someone with severe exhaustion.\n\nConsidering the need for rest as a treatment for exhaustion, especially in a pregnant woman who needs to take care of her health for the sake of both herself and her baby, the most appropriate and comprehensive answer would be:\n\nANSWER: C",

It's often used for surveillance, control rooms, or situations requiring constant monitoring of multiple sources.\n\n2. **Application for Watching Moving Lines**: The context of \"watching moving lines\" suggests a need for surveillance or monitoring of traffic, production lines, or any scenario where movement or changes need to be observed across multiple points.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Options**:\n   - **A. Studios**: While studios use multiple monitors, they are more commonly associated with production and editing rather than surveillance.\n   - **B. Security Office**: This is a likely location for a monitor wall used for surveillance.\n   - **C. Hospital**: Hospitals use monitors for patient care but not typically for \"watching moving lines\" in the context of surveillance.\n   - **D. Department Store**: While department stores have security, a monitor wall specifically for watching moving lines might not be as critical as in other locations.\n   - **E. Guard Station**: This is also a likely location for surveillance monitoring.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Between B, E, and considering common applications, **B. security office** and **E. guard station** are closely related and both plausible.
