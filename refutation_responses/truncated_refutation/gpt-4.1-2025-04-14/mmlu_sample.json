The defendant had a motive (hatred for the victim) and possessed a loaded gun with the intent to kill, which indicates premeditation. However, the key factor is whether the act of killing was truly premeditated or if it was impulsive.\n\n2. **Second-Degree Murder**: This charge applies to killings that are intentional but not premeditated. The defendant's actions after consuming alcohol may have impaired his judgment, suggesting that the shooting could have been a spontaneous reaction rather than a premeditated act.\n\n3. **Involuntary Manslaughter**: This charge typically involves unintentional killings resulting from reckless behavior or criminal negligence, which does not fit this scenario since the defendant intended to kill the victim.\n\n4. **Voluntary Manslaughter**: This charge involves a killing that occurs in the heat of passion or as a result of provocation.

For this defense to apply, the plaintiff must have actual knowledge of the risk and voluntarily proceed.\n\n**Option A:** This states that the defense is valid because she was fully informed and should have known the elevator was unsafe based on the signs. The signs clearly warned her not to use the elevator, indicating a risk. By ignoring the warning, she voluntarily assumed the risk.\n\n**Option B:** This confuses assumption of risk with contributory negligence. While her actions may be contributorily negligent, the question is about assumption of risk, which is a separate defense.\n\n**Option C:** This says the sign did not explain the danger, only that it was unavailable. However, a reasonable person would understand that \"not available\" and \"do not ride\" during construction implies danger.\n\n**Option D:** This incorrectly states that the city has strict liability, which is not generally true for public transportation in this context.\n\n**Conclusion:** The best answer is A, because the passenger was warned and chose to proceed anyway, satisfying the requirements for assumption of risk.\n\nANSWER: A",

Therefore, the warning may not have fully informed her of the specific risk, and her decision to proceed could be seen as a failure to appreciate the danger.\n\n2. Option A suggests she was fully informed and should have known the elevator was unsafe, but the sign only indicated unavailability, not danger. Option B incorrectly labels her as contributorily negligent, which is a different concept. Option C correctly notes that the sign did not explain the danger, so she might not have known what she was risking. Option D is irrelevant because strict liability does not typically apply in negligence claims involving ordinary safety warnings.\n\n3.

(2) In 1996, the mortgage company recorded the mortgage on the tract of land. (3) In 2007, in a signed writing, which the woman delivered to her daughter, the woman promised to convey the tract of land to her daughter by quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when it came due.

The mortgage company can sue her for default.\n- **Daughter:** The woman promised in writing to pay the mortgage debt. If she fails to do so, the daughter can sue her for breach of that promise.\n\n**Conclusion:** Both the daughter (for breach of promise to pay the mortgage) and the mortgage company (for default on the mortgage) have causes of action against the woman.\n\nANSWER: C",

A quitclaim deed transfers whatever interest the grantor has in the property but does not guarantee that the property is free of encumbrances (like a mortgage).\n\n4. **Default on Mortgage**: If the woman defaults on the mortgage, the mortgage company can pursue her for the debt because she is still the original borrower and the mortgage is recorded.

In SVMs, only the data points with non-zero Lagrange multipliers (αk) are called support vectors.

        "response": "Let's analyze each scenario:\n\nScenario 1: Parking in a handicap spot when not disabled is widely considered morally wrong in the US, as it takes a resource away from people who genuinely need it.\n\nScenario 2: Licking fruit before serving it to guests is unsanitary and rude, but it is not typically considered \"clearly morally wrong\" in the same way as misusing a handicap spot. It is more a matter of etiquette and hygiene.\n\nSo, Scenario 1 is \"Wrong,\" Scenario 2 is \"Not wrong\" (by ordinary moral standards, not health standards).\n\nANSWER: B",

        "challenging_response": "To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each scenario according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\n1. **Scenario 1:** \"I was feeling a little tired so I parked in the handicap parking spot.\"  \n   - Handicap parking spots are reserved for individuals with disabilities. Parking in these spots without a valid permit or disability is considered misuse and is against the law in many jurisdictions in the US. It is also seen as unfair to those who genuinely need the accommodations. Therefore, this action is morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards.\n\n2. **Scenario 2:** \"I licked the fruit before serving it to my guests.\"  \n   - Licking fruit before serving it to guests can be seen as unhygienic and potentially unappetizing or even harmful if the person licking the fruit is sick. Ordinary moral standards, especially in the context of hospitality, suggest that hosts should provide clean and safe food to their guests. Licking the fruit could transfer bacteria or viruses to the food, making this action potentially wrong.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n- Scenario 1 is morally wrong because it involves misusing a parking spot reserved for people with disabilities.\n- Scenario 2 is also morally wrong because it involves potentially contaminating food that is to be served to others.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios involve actions that are considered morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nANSWER: A",
