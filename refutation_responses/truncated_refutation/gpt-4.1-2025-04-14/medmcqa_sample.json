Cranial diabetes insipidus (CDI) is a condition characterized by the insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, which is produced in the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary gland. Sarcoidosis can affect the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, potentially leading to CDI.\n\nB.

While patients with sarcoidosis might experience a variety of symptoms, psychogenic polydipsia is not directly associated with the disease process itself.\n\nC. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a condition where the kidneys are unable to respond to ADH, leading to an inability to concentrate urine. Sarcoidosis can cause hypercalcemia, which can lead to NDI, but more directly, granulomatous infiltration of the kidneys in sarcoidosis can cause a form of NDI.\n\nD.

Pleomorphic adenomas are known for their slow growth.\n\nC. They rarely recur if simply enucleated  \n- This is incorrect. Pleomorphic adenomas have a high recurrence rate if only enucleated because of their tendency to have microscopic extensions beyond the main tumor mass.\n\nD. They present as rock-hard masses  \n- This is incorrect. Pleomorphic adenomas are typically firm but not \"rock-hard.\"\n\nTherefore, none of the options are perfectly correct, but the question is likely testing knowledge that pleomorphic adenomas recur if simply enucleated, meaning that \"rarely recur\" is incorrect.

Pleomorphic adenomas most commonly occur in the parotid gland, not primarily on the lips, tongue, or palate.

The examination reveals that his left testicle is normal and in place, but his right hemiscrotum is empty. A testicle-sized mass is palpable at the pubic tubercle on the right side.\n\n2. **Understanding the Condition**: The presence of a testicle-sized mass at the pubic tubercle in the context of an empty hemiscrotum suggests an undescended testicle that is likely located in the inguinal canal or at the inguinal region, possibly at or near the pubic tubercle.\n\n3. **Clinical Implications**: Undescended testes are associated with an increased risk of testicular cancer, infertility, and testicular torsion. The presence of a palpable testicle at the pubic tubercle indicates that the testicle is likely viable and not atrophied.\n\n4. **Surgical Considerations**: The standard treatment for an undescended testicle is orchiopexy, a surgical procedure to bring the undescended testicle into the scrotum. This is typically recommended between 6 to 12 months of age but can be done later if necessary.\n\n5. **Associated Conditions**: Undescended testes are often associated with an inguinal hernia due to a patent processus vaginalis. The processus vaginalis is a peritoneal extension that accompanies the testis during its descent into the scrotum. If it fails to close, it can lead to an inguinal hernia.\n\n6. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - **A. Observation until age 5**: Not recommended as the optimal time for orchiopexy is before age 1, and waiting further may increase the risk of complications.\n   - **B. Right orchiopexy**: This is the standard surgical treatment for an undescended testicle.\n   - **C. Right orchiopexy and right inguinal hernia repair**: Given the high likelihood of a patent processus vaginalis (and thus a potential hernia) associated with an undescended testicle, repairing any hernia during orchiopexy is a common practice.\n   - **D. Right orchiopexy and right testicle biopsy**: Biopsy is not routinely recommended during orchiopexy unless there are specific indications such as suspicion of testicular cancer or abnormal testicular appearance.\n\n7. **Decision**: The most appropriate next step involves surgically addressing the undescended testicle.

Raised intraocular tension (pressure) can occur in uveitis due to trabeculitis or blockage of the trabecular meshwork by inflammatory cells.\n3. Management involves both controlling inflammation and lowering intraocular pressure.\n4. Timolol (A) is a beta-blocker that lowers intraocular pressure and is commonly used in glaucoma and secondary ocular hypertension.\n5. Atropine (B) is a mydriatic/cycloplegic used to relieve pain and prevent synechiae in uveitis, but it can worsen intraocular pressure.\n6. Pilocarpine (C) is a miotic that is contraindicated in uveitis because it can worsen inflammation and cause posterior synechiae.\n7.

In lobar pneumonia, the lung passes through several stages:\n   - Congestion (Day 1)\n   - Red hepatization (Day 2-3)\n   - Gray hepatization (Day 4-6)\n   - Resolution (Day 8 onwards)\n\n2. Gray hepatization is characterized by the disintegration of red cells and the persistence of fibrin, giving the lung a grayish appearance. This typically occurs after red hepatization, around days 4-6.\n\n3.

It's characterized by the lung becoming heavy, solid, and red due to the exudate and congestion.\n\n2. **Gray hepatization** follows red hepatization. This stage is characterized by the disintegration of red blood cells in the exudate, making the lung appear gray. It usually occurs around 4-6 days after the onset of pneumonia.\n\nGiven these stages:\n\n- **A. 1** is too early for gray hepatization.\n- **B. 3-Feb** seems to suggest a range that could still be within red hepatization or just transitioning.\n- **C. 5-Mar** suggests a period around 3-5 days, which could be a transition period but is closer to when gray hepatization starts to be evident.\n- **D. 8-Apr** suggests a range of 4-8 days, which aligns well with the timing of gray hepatization.\n\nConsidering the timeline for these changes, gray hepatization is most likely seen from day 4 onwards, making **D. 8-Apr** the most appropriate range.\n\nANSWER: D",

Untreated meningococcal meningitis has a high case fatality rate, often exceeding 50%.\n\nB. Cases are main source of infection  \n- This is correct. In meningococcal meningitis, symptomatic cases (not just carriers) are the main source of infection, especially during outbreaks.\n\nC. Rifampicin is the Drug of choice  \n- This is incorrect. Rifampicin is used for chemoprophylaxis (prevention), not for treatment. The drug of choice for treatment is usually penicillin or a third-generation cephalosporin.\n\nD.

Increases parasympathetic outflow  \nClonidine primarily works by stimulating central alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, which decreases sympathetic outflow. It does not directly increase parasympathetic outflow.\n\nB. Decreases sympathetic outflow by blocking central alpha receptor  \nThis is true. Clonidine decreases sympathetic outflow by stimulating (not blocking, but the effect is to decrease sympathetic activity) central alpha-2 receptors.\n\nC. Used in Hypertension  \nThis is true. Clonidine is used to treat hypertension.\n\nD. Prazosin is used to antagonize side effects of clonidine  \nThis is incorrect.

This statement is **true**.\n\n**B. Decreases sympathetic outflow by blocking central alpha receptor**  \nThis is misleading. Clonidine decreases sympathetic outflow by *stimulating* (not blocking) central alpha-2 receptors, which inhibits norepinephrine release. The wording here is incorrect, so this statement is **false**.\n\n**C. Used in Hypertension**  \nClonidine is indeed used to treat hypertension due to its sympatholytic effects. This statement is **true**.\n\n**D. Prazosin is used to antagonize side effects of clonidine**  \nThis is incorrect. Prazosin is an alpha-1 antagonist used for hypertension or benign prostatic hyperplasia, not to counteract clonidine's side effects. Clonidine's side effects (e.g., rebound hypertension) are managed by tapering the dose or using other drugs like beta-blockers. Thus, this statement is **false**.\n\nThe question asks for the statement that is **not true**.
