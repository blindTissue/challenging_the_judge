Recent discoveries in this region have revealed cave paintings that include animals and hand stencils, with some of the oldest dating back over 40,000 years. These findings are significant because they push back the timeline of early human art.\n\n- Option A mentions animals and human bodies from 15,000 to 20,000 years ago, which is relatively recent compared to recent discoveries.\n- Option B mentions animals and hand stencils from over 35,000 to 40,000 years ago, aligning with recent findings.\n- Option C suggests even older dates (45,000 to 100,000 years ago), which is less supported by current evidence.\n- Option D includes animals and geometric shapes from 15,000 to over 100,000 years ago, which is too broad and less specific.\n\nGiven the recent discoveries, the most accurate description is that the images include animals and hand stencils dating back more than 35,000 years, fitting with current archaeological evidence.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "question": "At a metro station in the city, there is always significant construction going on, including a rebuild of the elevator shaft between the platform and the ground level. There is a sign warning \"this elevator is not available at this time, please do not ride it.\" A passenger sees the signs, but tries to ride the elevator anyway, and is injured when she falls into the shaft. When the passenger sues the city for negligence, the city states that she assumed the risk. Is that a valid and accurate defense under the circumstances?",
        "answer": "C",
        "choices": [
            "Yes, because she was fully informed and should have known that the elevator was unsafe based upon the signs.",
            "Yes, because the signs make her contributorily negligent and a legal cause of her own injury.",
            "No, because the sign did not explain the danger and only told her that it was not available, and she therefore did not know what she was encountering.",
            "No, because the city has strict liability when everyone is depending on the subway."
        ],
        "response": "1. The key issue is whether the passenger's attempt to use the elevator despite the warning constitutes assumption of the risk. Assumption of the risk requires that the plaintiff knew of the danger and voluntarily exposed herself to it. The sign warned that the elevator was not available, but did not specify the danger of falling into the shaft. Therefore, the warning may not have fully informed her of the specific risk, and her decision to proceed could be seen as a failure to appreciate the danger.\n\n2. Option A suggests she was fully informed and should have known the elevator was unsafe, but the sign only indicated unavailability, not danger. Option B incorrectly labels her as contributorily negligent, which is a different concept. Option C correctly notes that the sign did not explain the danger, so she might not have known what she was risking. Option D is irrelevant because strict liability does not typically apply in negligence claims involving ordinary safety warnings.\n\n3. The most accurate defense depends on whether the warning was sufficient to inform her of the danger. Since it was not, assumption of risk is not fully valid here.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "response": "1. The poem \"The White Man's Burden\" by Kipling is often interpreted as a call for the United States and other Western powers to undertake the civilizing mission of imperialism, emphasizing the duty and burden of colonizers to bring benefits to \"less-developed\" peoples, despite the hardships involved. The language such as \"send forth the best ye breed,\" \"serve your captives' need,\" and \"take up the White Man's burden\" suggests a sense of responsibility and moral obligation placed on the imperial powers.\n\n2. The poem does not warn against war (B), nor does it explicitly focus on Christianization (C), nor does it present irony or criticize imperialism as folly (D).

The poem speaks of taking up the \"White Man's burden\" and sending forth the best to serve the needs of \"new-caught, sullen peoples, / Half-devil and half-child.\" This language suggests a paternalistic and condescending attitude towards the colonized people. The poem also mentions \"the savage wars of peace\" and the need to \"Fill full the mouth of Famine / And bid the sickness cease,\" which implies a sense of duty to civilize and improve the lives of the colonized.\n\nHowever, the tone of the poem is complex, and the language used is often ironic and critical. The phrase \"half-devil and half-child\" is particularly problematic, as it dehumanizes and infantilizes the colonized people. The poem also warns of the difficulties and hardships of imperialism, saying \"Watch sloth and heathen Folly / Bring all your hopes to naught.\" This suggests that Kipling is not simply advocating for imperialism, but rather presenting a nuanced and critical view of it.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most appropriate answer is D.

There's no indication that the children are being neglected or that the act of ironing is inherently wrong. In fact, doing chores is generally considered a responsible behavior. Therefore, according to ordinary moral standards, there's nothing clearly morally wrong with this action, assuming the children are safe and being appropriately supervised.\n\n2. **Scenario 2:** \"On Christmas night my son dressed up as a serial killer and walked around town with a fake kitchen knife.\" This scenario involves a child dressing up in a costume that could be perceived as disturbing or insensitive (serial killer) and carrying a fake weapon (kitchen knife). While the intent might be to dress up for a holiday or event, the choice of costume could be seen as potentially promoting or glorifying violence. However, the use of \"fake\" indicates it's not a real weapon, and the context is likely a form of play or celebration. The morality can depend on the specifics, like the age of the son and the reaction of others. Generally, dressing up in costume for holidays is a common and accepted practice in the US, and as long as the costume isn't causing harm or undue disturbance, it might not be considered wrong.\n\nGiven these analyses:\n\n- **Scenario 1** is not morally wrong as it involves a responsible parent doing chores while their children play.\n- **Scenario 2**, while potentially controversial due to the nature of the costume, is still within the realm of dressing up for a holiday or event, which is a common practice. The fact that it's a \"fake kitchen knife\" suggests an attempt to avoid causing alarm, which leans towards it not being clearly morally wrong.\n\nTherefore, neither scenario clearly describes a morally wrong action according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.\n\nANSWER: D",

Assuming pressure \\( P \\) and amount of gas \\( n \\) are constant, volume \\( V \\) is proportional to \\( T \\). Since \\( C \\) is proportional to the diameter, and volume \\( V \\propto C^3 \\), then \\( C^3 \\propto T \\). Plotting \\( C^3 \\) versus \\( T \\) should yield a linear (direct) relationship, not cubic or other forms.\n\n2. The question asks about the relationship between \\( C^3 \\) and \\( T \\). Given the proportionality, the relationship should be linear, meaning \\( C^3 \\) increases directly with \\( T \\).\n\n3.

Since the circumference (C) of a sphere (like a balloon) is related to its radius (r) by C = 2πr, and the volume (V) of a sphere is related to its radius by V = (4/3)πr^3, there's a direct relationship between the volume of the gas and the cube of the circumference (C^3) of the balloon.\n\nGiven that the volume of the gas increases with temperature, the radius of the balloon (and thus its circumference) will also increase with temperature.

Strict liability generally applies to inherently dangerous activities, not professional negligence. Breach of contract involves parties in a contractual relationship, which is not specified here.

It's more commonly applied in cases involving inherently dangerous activities or products, not professional services like auditing.\n\n2. **Breach of Contract (B)**: This occurs when one party fails to fulfill their obligations under a contract. For a CPA's liability to third parties under breach of contract, there would need to be a direct contractual relationship between the CPA and those third parties, which is not typically the case for unknown third parties.\n\n3. **Negligence (C)**: Negligence involves a failure to behave with the level of care that someone of ordinary prudence would have exercised under the same circumstances. When a CPA recklessly departs from the standards of due care, they can be considered negligent. This principle can apply to third parties who rely on the audit, even if they are unknown to the CPA, under certain conditions (like the Ultramares doctrine, which limits liability to foreseeable third-party beneficiaries).\n\n4. **Gross Negligence (D)**: Gross negligence represents an extreme departure from the standard of care, showing a significant lack of concern for the well-being of others. While recklessly departing from standards of due care could be considered gross negligence, the question specifically asks about liability to unknown third parties, which is more directly addressed by the concept of negligence rather than the degree of negligence (gross vs. ordinary).\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate answer is related to the failure to meet the standard of care expected in professional auditing services, which directly points to negligence as the relevant legal principle for liability to third parties.\n\nANSWER: C",

When a CPA recklessly departs from the standards of due care, they can be considered negligent. This principle can apply to third parties who rely on the audit, even if they are unknown to the CPA, under certain conditions (like the Ultramares doctrine, which limits liability to foreseeable third-party beneficiaries). 4. **Gross Negligence (D)**: Gross negligence represents an extreme departure from the standard of care, showing a significant lack of concern for the well-being of others. While recklessly departing from standards of due care could be considered gross negligence, the question specifically asks about liability to unknown third parties, which is more directly addressed by the concept of negligence rather than the degree of negligence (gross vs. ordinary).

However, during the actual vote, 56% of those who voted were against annexation. The difference lies in the participation: not all eligible voters voted, but the percentage of voters against annexation was lower than the percentage of survey respondents against it.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Choices**:\n\n   A. **Nonresponse Bias**: This refers to the bias that occurs when a group of people are systematically less likely to respond to a survey. In this case, the difference in percentages (58% vs. 56%) could be due to those who voted having different opinions than those who didn't respond to the survey or didn't vote. This seems like a plausible explanation.\n\n   B. **Selection Bias**: This refers to the systematic difference between a statistic (from a sample) and a parameter (of a population) caused by the nonrandom selection of surveyed persons. While this could be a factor, the scenario specifically highlights a difference between a survey and an actual vote, not just a sample vs. a population parameter.\n\n   C. **Sampling Variability**: This refers to the natural fluctuation that occurs when different samples are taken from the same population. However, this scenario doesn't explicitly mention two different samples being compared but rather a survey sample versus a voting outcome.\n\n   D. **Sampling Error**: This is the difference between a statistic and the truth due to the use of a random sample. While sampling error could account for some discrepancies, the scenario hints at a more specific issue related to who participated (or didn't) in the vote versus the survey.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The scenario best fits with **nonresponse bias** because the key difference seems to be between those who responded to the survey (and possibly would have voted) and those who actually voted. The fact that not all eligible voters voted, and the percentage against annexation changed, suggests that those who didn't vote might have had different opinions than those who did, which skews the results.\n\nANSWER: A",

The defendant eventually stumbled into the bathroom where he spotted a purse lying on the floor under the sink. Wondering vaguely if it might contain more beer, he opened it up and found his friend's wallet. He grabbed some money from the wallet and left the bathroom. As he was descending the stairs with the money in his hand, his friend spotted him. She was initially concerned he might tumble down the stairs but upon seeing the money in his hand, she asked him where he got it. The defendant responded, \"Ha! Your money or your life!\" Not taking him seriously, the friend let him pass by. It wasn't until later that she realized that the defendant had taken the money from her wallet.

He entered the bathroom where the wallet was located, but there is no indication he broke into the house or the bathroom specifically, so burglary (which requires unlawful entry with intent to commit a crime) may not be established solely from this act.  \n3. The defendant's statement, \"Your money or your life,\" suggests an attempt at extortion or coercion, but since he did not threaten or demand anything in a way that would constitute extortion, and he simply took the money, extortion is not clearly established.  \n4. Robbery involves taking property from someone through force or intimidation. While the defendant was intoxicated and the situation was somewhat confrontational, there is no evidence he used force or threats to obtain the money at the moment of taking it.  \n5.

The defendant was already inside his friend's house, so there's no breaking and entering. Thus, burglary is not applicable.\n\n3. **Robbery**: Robbery is larceny from a person or in their presence by force or threat of force. The defendant took the money from the wallet when his friend was not present, and he didn't use force or threat of force to take it. Although he later made a threatening statement (\"Ha! Your money or your life!\"), it was after the taking, and his friend didn't take it seriously.

The defendant's statement could be seen as an attempt to threaten, but since his friend didn't take it seriously and he didn't actually obtain any additional property through the threat, it might be considered attempted extortion.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- The defendant committed **larceny** when he took the money from his friend's wallet.\n- There's no **burglary** since the defendant was already inside the house.\n- The act doesn't constitute **robbery** because the taking wasn't by force or threat of force in the presence of the victim.\n- The statement \"Ha!

The daughter’s promise and deed do not extinguish or supersede the mortgage lien.\n\n2. Under a grantor-grantee index jurisdiction, the mortgage's priority is determined by the date of recording.

The daughter's cause of action is not against the woman for breach of the promise to pay the debt, but rather she has no direct claim to the property free of the mortgage lien.\n\nThus, the reasoning overstates the daughter's rights and underestimates the mortgage's priority. The correct conclusion is that only the mortgage company has a cause of action against the woman.\n\nANSWER: B",

The woman delivered a quitclaim deed, transferring her interest in the land to the daughter, but without referencing the mortgage. Given these steps, the woman is still obligated to the mortgage company for the debt (since the quitclaim deed did not affect this obligation). The daughter, having received the land with no mention of the mortgage, might argue she is not responsible for the debt, but the woman's prior promise to pay the debt creates a contractual obligation between the woman and the daughter. Thus, both the mortgage company (for the debt) and the daughter (for breach of the promise to pay the debt) have causes of action against the woman.\nANSWER:  C\n---\nConsider the *available information* in this reasoning alongside your own prior analysis.

The agreed upon price was $250,000, with construction to be completed within four months. Two weeks after the building contract was formed, the builder contacted a lumber yard to purchase wood necessary for the construction of the house. The builder and the owner of the lumber yard entered into a valid written agreement whereby the lumber yard was to supply the necessary lumber in exchange for $10,000, payable by the builder within 30 days. One week later, a fire destroyed a good portion of the lumber yard's supply of lumber. As a result, the lumber yard refused to supply lumber to the builder. The builder was unable to find another supplier of lumber and therefore notified the woman that he would be unable to complete her building on time.

Given the description that the characteristic leads to difficulty in standardizing the delivery of services around the blueprint model, the focus is on the inherent variability or inconsistency in service delivery, which makes standardization hard.\nANSWER:  C\n---\nConsider the *available information* in this reasoning alongside your own prior analysis.

        "response": "1. The patient is expressing intense negative feelings about his missing child, calling him worthless, which suggests a defense mechanism to manage unacceptable feelings. His behavior toward staff (berating them) indicates a pattern of hostility or denial of vulnerability. Projection involves attributing one's own unacceptable feelings or impulses to others. Given the context, the patient's harsh judgment of his child and hostility toward staff are consistent with projecting his own feelings of worthlessness or anger onto others.\n\n2. Projection is a defense mechanism where an individual unconsciously attributes their own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to someone else, often to reduce anxiety or guilt.\n\n3.

This is characteristic of covert sensitization, a form of aversive therapy where a negative association is linked with an undesirable behavior or fantasy to reduce its occurrence.\n\n2. Orgasmic reconditioning involves replacing an unwanted sexual response with a more appropriate one, but it typically involves changing the object of arousal rather than switching fantasies at orgasm. Aversive conditioning involves pairing an unwanted behavior with an aversive stimulus, but here the focus is on switching fantasies, not pairing behavior with punishment. Desensitization therapy involves gradual exposure to a stimulus to reduce anxiety, which doesn't fit this context.\n\n3.

His work \"De Officiis\" is a significant source for understanding his views on what is morally right and wrong.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Options**:\n   - **A. Commit acts of injustice**: Cicero generally advocates for justice and doing what is right. However, he also discusses situations where the greater good might justify actions that would otherwise be considered wrong.\n   - **B. Break one’s promises**: Cicero discusses the importance of keeping promises and the moral obligations associated with them. However, he also considers exceptions, particularly when keeping a promise would lead to greater harm or violate a higher moral duty.\n   - **C. Steal**: Stealing is generally considered wrong. Cicero's philosophy emphasizes the importance of respecting others' property and not engaging in acts like theft.\n   - **D. None of the above**: This option suggests that Cicero would not condone any of the actions listed under certain circumstances.\n\n3. **Cicero's Views on Moral Flexibility**: In \"De Officiis,\" Cicero suggests that there are situations where strict adherence to moral rules might not be appropriate if it leads to greater harm or if it conflicts with a higher moral duty.

Courts often consider whether the manufacturer took reasonable steps to warn users, especially when language barriers exist. Since the immigrant did not understand the warning and there is no indication the company provided warnings in other languages or took additional steps to inform non-English speakers, the company may be liable.\n\n2. The correct answer should reflect that the company’s failure to provide an understandable warning could make it liable, regardless of the immigrant’s failure to read or make the patch test.\n\n3.

        "challenging_response": "To determine the most likely outcome of the immigrant's suit against the company for strict products liability, let's analyze the key elements of strict products liability and how they apply to this scenario.\n\n1. **Strict Products Liability**: This doctrine holds manufacturers liable for injuries caused by their products if the product is unreasonably dangerous or defective. The injured party must show that the product was defective when it left the manufacturer's control, that it was used in a manner reasonably foreseeable to the manufacturer, and that the defect caused the injury.\n\n2. **Warning and Instructions**: A manufacturer can avoid liability if it provides adequate warnings or instructions about the product's safe use, and the user fails to follow them, thereby assuming the risk. However, for a warning to be effective, it must be communicated in a way that the intended user can understand.\n\nGiven these principles, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. **win, because she suffered injury from her use of the product.** - While it's true that the immigrant suffered an injury, strict liability also requires that the product was defective and that the use was reasonably foreseeable. The presence of a warning could potentially affect liability.\n\nB. **win, because the manufacturer was aware that a small percentage of the population would suffer an allergic reaction to the shampoo.** - The manufacturer's awareness of potential allergic reactions led to the inclusion of a warning. However, the effectiveness of this warning is in question due to the language barrier.\n\nC. **lose, because she didn't read or speak English.** - This option addresses the issue of the warning's effectiveness. If the immigrant couldn't understand the warning due to a language barrier, she couldn't be expected to follow it. This situation could make the product not reasonably safe as marketed.\n\nD. **lose, because she assumed the risk by not making the \"patch test.\"** - Assumption of risk requires that the user knows of the risk and voluntarily proceeds in the face of that risk. If the immigrant didn't understand the warning, she couldn't have knowingly assumed the risk.\n\nConsidering these points, the immigrant's inability to read or understand the warning due to her not speaking English is crucial. The manufacturer failed to ensure that the warning was effectively communicated to all potential users, which could make the product not reasonably safe for its intended use.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "question": "A man conveys to his wife's cousin a property to \"cousin and the heirs of his body.\" He then conveys the same property to his niece in fee simple. Under modern real estate laws and practice in most states today, what interest if any does his niece have?",

            "The conveyance gives the niece nothing because the property was already conveyed in fee simple to his wife's cousin.",

        ],
        "response": "Let's analyze the scenario step by step:\n\n1. The man first conveys the property \"to his wife's cousin and the heirs of his body.\" This language typically creates a fee tail or a fee simple subject to an executory limitation, depending on jurisdiction, but in modern law, such language often defaults to a fee simple absolute unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\n2. The second conveyance is to his niece in fee simple. Since the property was already conveyed to the cousin, the second conveyance is a subsequent transfer.\n\n3. Under modern laws, once the property is conveyed to the cousin, the niece's interest depends on whether the first conveyance was valid and whether it created a fee tail or fee simple.\n\n4. Most states have abolished or limited the use of fee tails, and the language \"and the heirs of his body\" is often interpreted as creating a fee simple absolute in modern practice, or at least a fee simple subject to a condition.\n\n5. The second conveyance to the niece in fee simple generally would vest her with a fee simple interest, unless the first conveyance created a fee tail or similar limited estate that would restrict subsequent transfers.\n\n6. Since the first conveyance was to the cousin and his heirs of the body, which in modern law often defaults to a fee simple, the second conveyance to the niece in fee simple would generally be valid and vest her with a fee simple interest.\n\nTherefore, the niece has a fee simple interest.\n\nAnswer choice D reflects this conclusion.\n\nANSWER: D",

However, under modern real estate law in most states, fee tails have been abolished or converted into fee simple estates. So, the cousin would receive a fee simple absolute, not a fee tail.\n\n3. The second conveyance is to the niece in fee simple. But if the cousin already has a fee simple (from the first conveyance), the grantor has nothing left to give to the niece.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n- A. The niece gets nothing because the property was already conveyed in fee simple to the cousin. This matches the modern rule.\n- B. She gets a reversion if the cousin has no heirs. This would be true under fee tail, but not under modern law.\n- C. A contingent remainder. Not applicable, as the cousin has a fee simple.\n- D. She has a fee simple.

This suggests that the settlement was fair and reflective of the actual value of the work performed. 4.\n ...Based on this analysis, the contractor is unlikely to succeed in challenging the validity of the settlement agreement because the homeowner's payment and the acceptance of that payment by the contractor constitute a valid settlement.\nANSWER:  A\n---\nConsider the *available information* in this reasoning alongside your own prior analysis.

He decided to just park along the road next to the store, even though there was not really a lane or space there intended for parking. The driver pulled his car as far off the roadway as he could and figured that it would be fine because he would only be in the store for a few minutes. While the driver was in the store, a car driven by a woman approached the spot where the driver had left his car. When the woman saw the driver's car and realized it was partially obstructing the road, she tried to avoid hitting it but crashed into it. The accident caused $5,000 worth of damage to the driver's car and $1,000 worth of damage to the woman's car.

The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military . . . was relaxed . . . ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.\n—Adapted from Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, by Edward Gibbon\nMost classical empires shared which of the following traits?",

For example, merit-based bureaucracies are more typical of later periods (e.g., Han China), and state support of foreign religions was not a defining trait of all classical empires.\n\n3.

While walking home from the bar, the defendant bumped into the victim. As soon as the defendant recognized him, he pulled out his gun and shot and killed the victim.

Since the store refused to sell the necklace based on a house rule, even though the man was the first to arrive, the key issue is whether the advertisement constitutes a binding offer and whether the store can impose such conditions.

This makes the statements hearsay under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE).\n\n2. **Hearsay Exception**: The question is whether the pedestrian's statements under hypnosis fall under a recognized hearsay exception. The pedestrian's statements are not a \"past recollection refreshed\" (as in option B), because that doctrine applies to a witness's own written or recorded statement used to refresh their memory while testifying, not to statements made under hypnosis. \n\n3. **Reliability of Hypnosis**: Courts generally view statements made under hypnosis with skepticism because hypnosis can distort memory, create false memories, and make it impossible to determine whether the recalled information is accurate or fabricated. For this reason, most jurisdictions hold that hypnotically induced testimony is inadmissible due to its unreliability. \n\n4. **License Plate Confirmation**: While the driver concedes that the license plate number is correct, this does not automatically make the rest of the hypnotically induced testimony reliable or admissible. The accuracy of one detail does not validate the entire statement, especially given the unreliability of hypnosis. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n5. **Authentication**: Option D suggests the statements cannot be authenticated as truthful.

The defendant was inside the store waiting for his coffee when a member of the city's parking enforcement department drove by the vehicle. Seeing that there was no handicapped sticker on the car, the parking official stopped and started ticketing the vehicle. When the defendant came outside, he got into an argument with the parking official. After the defendant became verbally abusive, the parking official told him to desist or he was going to impound the vehicle. After the defendant continued his badgering, the parking official told him that he was impounding the vehicle and called the station house for officer assistance. A few minutes later, a police officer arrived on the scene. He asked the defendant for identification and then proceeded to frisk him for weapons. The officer found a clear vial containing heroin in the defendant's back pocket. He then placed the defendant under arrest. Thereupon, the parking official went into the defendant's car and began an inventory search. In this jurisdiction, parking enforcement personnel have statutory authority to conduct inventory searches of impounded vehicles. The parking official did not find anything of interest. After the police officer placed the defendant in the patrol car, the officer asked the parking official if he could search the vehicle, to which the parking official responded yes.

The defendant initially refused to hand over his bag, and the officers then conditioned his ability to board the plane on inspecting the bag. When the defendant decided not to fly, the officers still insisted on taking his bag. This suggests the detention was not consensual, and the seizure of the bag may have exceeded the bounds of a lawful investigative detention under the Fourth Amendment.\n\n2. **Overnight Detention of the Bag**: The police held the bag overnight before conducting a dog sniff. For a detention of property to be reasonable, it must be supported by reasonable suspicion and conducted in a manner that is not overly intrusive or prolonged. Here, the overnight delay without probable cause or a warrant likely rendered the detention unreasonable.\n\n3. **Dog Sniff and Search**: While a dog sniff is not a \"search\" under the Fourth Amendment, the initial seizure of the bag must still be lawful. If the detention of the bag was unlawful, the subsequent discovery of heroin would be the fruit of an unconstitutional seizure and thus inadmissible.\n\n4. **Applicable Precedent**: Under *Florida v. Royer* (1983), police may briefly detain a person for questioning based on reasonable suspicion, but the detention must not be overly intrusive or prolonged.
