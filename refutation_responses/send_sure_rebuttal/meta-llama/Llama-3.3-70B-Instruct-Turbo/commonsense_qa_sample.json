The change might be minimal or not directly related to clarity, but it's still a change.\n   - D. **opaque**: Making something opaque means making it not transparent. Using clear tape wouldn't make the glasses opaque, so this doesn't directly relate to Joe's action with clear tape.\n   - E. **thick**: While adding tape could make the glasses \"thicker\" in a literal sense, the term doesn't directly relate to the effect on the field of vision in the context provided.\n\n4. **Choosing the best answer**: The most relevant term that relates to Joe's intention or the effect of his action (putting clear tape on his glasses) on his field of vision is \"change.\" Joe didn't want to change his field of vision, and using clear tape is a way to minimize the change.\n\nANSWER: C",

The professor spoke in a \"reserved, conservative, and laconic tone.\" The word \"laconic\" means using few words, being concise. \n\nGiven this, the professor was avoiding language that is excessive or overly elaborate. Options A, B, C, D, and E all generally refer to using more words than necessary or being overly talkative. However, the most direct antonyms of \"laconic\" in this context would be words that describe using an excessive number of words.\n\nOptions B, C, D, and E (loquacious, verbose, talkative, prolix) all describe someone who talks a lot or uses too many words. Option A (bombastic) refers to language that is overly pompous or self-important, which doesn't directly contrast with being laconic in terms of word count but does imply a certain level of excess in language use.\n\nConsidering the direct contrast to \"laconic,\" the best answer would focus on the aspect of using too many words.

While still used, the term is more specific and less likely to be the primary source of general information.\n   - **E. meeting** involves interpersonal communication and is not typically considered a primary method for finding general information.\n\n4. **Making a decision**: Between \"internet\" and \"online,\" both are viable. However, \"online\" is a broader term that encompasses not just the internet but any activity done while connected to a network. \"Internet\" is more specific and directly refers to the global network of interconnected computers. Both A and C could be correct, but given that \"online\" essentially means being on the internet or another network, and considering the phrasing of the question, the most straightforward and encompassing choice is \"internet\" or \"online.\" Since \"online\" is a synonym for being connected to the internet and is used interchangeably in many contexts regarding information seeking, and it directly answers \"where\" people find information, it's a strong candidate.\n\n5. **Choosing between A and C**: Both are essentially correct, but the question is about the most appropriate answer. \"Online\" is a bit broader and can include information not strictly on the internet (though this is a fine distinction). \"Internet\" is direct and clear.\n\nGiven the context and the need for conciseness, the best answer is **C. online** because it is a more general term that can include various sources of information available through network connections, and it's directly related to how people currently access information.\n\nANSWER: C",

The old man is described as retired and enjoying simple things, which suggests he's looking for activities that bring him comfort and fulfillment in his daily life. Doing crossword puzzles every morning indicates he's seeking a quiet, engaging activity.\n\nOption A, \"you're bored,\" doesn't fit well because the statement is about the old man's preference, not the reason for his action. Option E, \"win,\" is also unlikely since the context doesn't imply competition. Option D, \"mentally challenged,\" could be a reason, but it's not the most straightforward answer given the context of enjoying simple things.\n\nBetween options B, \"pass time,\" and C, \"relax,\" both could be plausible. However, \"pass time\" is a more general reason that could apply to many activities, whereas \"relax\" specifically aligns with the idea of enjoying simple, calming activities in retirement.\n\nGiven the emphasis on enjoying simple things and the context of a quiet morning activity, the most fitting reason is to relax, as it directly relates to the enjoyment and calmness such activities can provide.\n\nANSWER: C",

Underground - Buildings here would be limited by space and accessibility, suggesting smaller structures.\nD. Town - While smaller than a city, towns can still have a variety of building sizes.\nE. In ant town - This option implies a colony of ants, where any structures would be extremely small, but it's not directly comparable to human-scale buildings.\n\nConsidering the need for buildings to be small due to physical constraints, option C (underground) and option E (in ant town) both suggest small buildings. However, given the context of human construction, option E is less relevant. \n\nANSWER: E",
