The gas smells different from the air**: This is irrelevant because CO₂ is odorless, and the demonstration does not rely on smell.\n   - **D. The gas evaporates faster than the air**: This is incorrect because CO₂ does not evaporate in this context; it is already a gas, and its behavior is due to density, not evaporation.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The ability to pour CO₂ gas is due to its higher density compared to air.\n\nANSWER: A",

This is not because the metal spoon is inherently hotter, but because of how it interacts with the heat from the soup.\n\n2. **Option A**: \"Metal is always hotter than wood.\"  \n   This is incorrect because the temperature of the spoons depends on the heat source (the soup), not an inherent property of the materials. The metal spoon feels hotter due to heat transfer, not because it is always hotter.\n\n3. **Option B**: \"Metal conducts heat better than wood.\"  \n   This is correct. Metals are good thermal conductors, meaning they transfer heat quickly from the soup to your hand. Wood, being a poor conductor, does not transfer heat as effectively, so it feels less hot.\n\n4. **Option C**: \"Metal conducts electricity better than wood.\"  \n   While this is true, it is irrelevant to the question, which is about heat conduction, not electrical conduction.\n\n5. **Option D**: \"Metal heats up the water better than the wood.\"  \n   This is incorrect because the spoons are not heating the water; they are being heated by the water.

Decreasing the amount of fresh water**: While deforestation can disrupt local water cycles, the Amazon rain forest's impact on global fresh water supplies is not the most direct or significant global effect. This option is not the best choice.\n\n**B. Increasing the number of animal species**: Deforestation actually reduces biodiversity by destroying habitats, leading to a decrease, not an increase, in the number of animal species. This option is incorrect.\n\n**C. Decreasing the average yearly temperatures**: Trees absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, and their removal typically leads to higher temperatures due to increased greenhouse gas concentrations. Thus, deforestation would not decrease temperatures. This option is incorrect.\n\n**D. Increasing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere**: Trees act as carbon sinks, absorbing carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. When trees are cut down, this carbon is released back into the atmosphere, and the forest's ability to absorb CO2 is reduced. This leads to higher global CO2 levels, contributing to climate change. This is the most direct and significant global effect of deforestation in the Amazon.\n\nThe correct answer is the option that addresses the global impact of increased CO2 levels due to deforestation.\n\nANSWER: D",

Blood pressure maintenance is more directly controlled by the cardiovascular system and nervous system.\n\n2. **Option B: Remove carbon dioxide**  \n   This is correct. During exercise, the respiratory system works with the cardiovascular system to remove carbon dioxide (a waste product of metabolism) from the blood. The cardiovascular system transports CO2 to the lungs, and the respiratory system expels it during exhalation.\n\n3. **Option C: Produce red blood cells**  \n   Red blood cell production is primarily the role of the bone marrow, not a collaborative function of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems during exercise.\n\n4. **Option D: Filter out waste products**  \n   While the cardiovascular system transports waste products, filtering them out is primarily the job of the kidneys (for metabolic wastes like urea) or the liver.

This fertilization is necessary for the formation of seeds and fruits (like apples).\n\n2. **Impact of killing all pollinators**:\n   - Without pollinators, the flowers of the apple trees would not be fertilized, which means the trees could not produce seeds (and thus no apples, since apples are the fruit that contains the seeds).\n   - The trees would still be able to make leaves, flowers, and bark, as these are not dependent on pollinators. Leaves are produced through photosynthesis, flowers are part of the tree's reproductive structure, and bark is produced by the tree's growth processes.\n\n3. **Evaluating the options**:\n   - **A. The trees could not make leaves**: Incorrect, as leaf production is unrelated to pollinators.\n   - **B.

Floods can erode soil, uproot plants, and disrupt animal habitats, causing significant damage.\n\n2. **Tornado (B)**: Tornadoes are common in prairie regions (e.g., Tornado Alley in the U.S.). While they can cause localized destruction, their narrow path means the overall impact on the vast prairie ecosystem is often limited.\n\n3. **Hurricane (C)**: Hurricanes primarily affect coastal regions and are rare in inland prairie areas. However, if a hurricane does reach a prairie, the heavy rains and winds could cause damage, though this is unlikely due to geographic distance from coasts.\n\n4. **Earthquake (D)**: Prairies are typically located in stable continental interiors with low seismic activity. Even if an earthquake occurs, the open landscape and resilient vegetation of prairies would minimize damage compared to other disasters.\n\nThe least likely to cause major damage is an earthquake, as prairies are not prone to seismic activity, and their ecosystems are less vulnerable to such events.\n\nANSWER: D",

This implies that the sidewalk itself is warmer than the air, causing the ice to melt despite the cold air.\n\n2. **Option A (The air heating the sidewalk)**: This is unlikely because the air temperature is colder than freezing, so the air cannot heat the sidewalk enough to melt the ice.\n\n3. **Option B (The sidewalk reflecting sunlight into the air)**: This does not explain why the ice melts. Reflecting sunlight into the air would not warm the sidewalk itself.\n\n4. **Option C (The wind causing the ice on the sidewalk to melt)**: Wind typically cools surfaces by increasing heat loss, not melts ice.

Fossils do not move on their own, and there's no mechanism mentioned that would explain their relocation.\n\n**B. The area had a shift in climate.**  \nWhile a climate shift could explain changes in the environment, it doesn't directly explain why sea organisms would be found in dry land. A shift from wet to dry doesn't account for the presence of marine fossils.\n\n**C. The land was once underwater.**  \nThis is the most plausible explanation. Fossils of sea organisms found on dry land suggest that the area was once covered by water, allowing these organisms to live and be preserved there. Over time, geological processes (like tectonic uplift) could have raised the land above water.\n\n**D. A glacier once covered the area.**  \nWhile glaciers can transport materials, they don't typically explain the presence of marine fossils in dry land.

Without this tilt, the sun's rays would strike the Earth uniformly throughout the year, eliminating seasonal variations. This is correct.  \n\n2. **Option B: One Earth-year would be 14% longer.**  \n   The length of a year is determined by the Earth's orbit around the sun, not its axial tilt.

        "response": "To answer this question, let's analyze the food chain and the relationships between the organisms:\n\n1. **Owls as predators**: Owls are one of the predators that eat squirrels. If owls are removed, the predation pressure on squirrels decreases. \n2. **Impact on squirrels**: With fewer predators (owls), the squirrel population would likely increase because there are now fewer organisms hunting them. \n3. **Impact on other predators (hawks and foxes)**: While hawks and foxes also prey on squirrels, the absence of owls does not directly affect their populations. They might benefit from the increased squirrel population, but the question asks for the *most likely* immediate outcome, which is the increase in squirrels. \n4. **Impact on trees**: The question does not provide evidence that the increased squirrel population would significantly reduce the tree population, as trees produce many seeds and are not solely dependent on squirrel predation for their survival.\n\nThus, the most direct and likely outcome is an increase in the squirrel population.\n\nANSWER: A",

Most have cells that are not able to exchange gases with the outside environment.**  \nThis is partially true, but it's not the primary reason. While some cells in multicellular organisms are not in direct contact with the external environment, the main issue is the inefficiency of diffusion over large distances, not just gas exchange.\n\n**B. Most have cells that are unable to grow and survive in their environment.**  \nThis is incorrect. The cells of multicellular organisms are adapted to their environment, but they require transport systems to efficiently distribute nutrients, oxygen, and remove waste due to the organism's size and complexity.\n\n**C. Most have cells that need food from sources outside their environment.**  \nThis is misleading. Cells in multicellular organisms rely on internal transport systems to distribute nutrients and oxygen, not because the food is outside their environment, but because diffusion alone is insufficient for larger organisms.\n\n**D.

The question focuses on how the louder cry *helps ensure survival*, not on physiological adaptations.\n\n2. **Exposure to bacteria is increased (B):** This is unlikely to be beneficial for survival. Increased exposure to bacteria would more likely harm the bird rather than help it survive.\n\n3. **Parents are able to identify the nest (C):** This is not directly relevant to the survival of individual nestlings. The nest location is typically known to the parents, and the louder cries of some nestlings don’t help identify the nest itself.\n\n4. **Parents respond by giving more food (D):** This is the most plausible explanation. Louder cries are often a signal of hunger or need, and parents may preferentially feed the louder nestlings, ensuring they receive more resources and thus have a higher chance of survival.\n\nThe key idea here is that louder cries are a competitive strategy to attract parental attention and resources, which directly enhances survival.\n\nANSWER: D",

This is a vast distance, much larger than what is typically measured in miles or meters, which are more suitable for terrestrial or solar system scales.\n\n2. **Units used by astronomers**:\n   - **Miles (A)**: While miles are familiar for everyday distances on Earth, they are impractical for interstellar distances due to the enormous numbers involved.\n   - **Meters (B)**: Like miles, meters are too small for interstellar distances and would result in unwieldy numbers (e.g., Proxima Centauri is about 40 trillion meters away).\n   - **Light years (C)**: This is the standard unit for interstellar distances. A light year is the distance light travels in one year, and it conveniently expresses the vast scales of space. Proxima Centauri's distance is naturally given in light years.\n   - **Astronomical units (D)**: Astronomical units (AU) are used for distances within the solar system (e.g., Earth-Sun distance). Proxima Centauri is about 268,000 AU away, but this unit is not commonly used for such large distances.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Astronomers most often use light years for distances to stars like Proxima Centauri because it provides a manageable and meaningful scale.\n\nANSWER: C",

This is not the primary mechanism preventing collapse.\n\n**B. The electrical repulsion of nuclei in the plasma**  \nWhile electrical repulsion does occur between nuclei, the temperatures and pressures in a star's core are so high that nuclei overcome this repulsion to undergo fusion.

A neutral atom has an equal number of protons (positive charge) and electrons (negative charge), so its net charge is zero. \n\n2. **Analyzing the options**:\n   - **A. more stable**: While some atoms may become more stable by gaining or losing electrons (e.g., achieving a noble gas configuration), this is not always true for all atoms. Stability depends on the specific atom and its electron configuration, so this is not a universal outcome.\n   - **B. an isotope**: Isotopes are variants of an element with different numbers of neutrons. Gaining or losing electrons does not change the number of neutrons, so this is incorrect.\n   - **C. an ion**: An ion is formed when an atom gains or loses electrons, resulting in a net positive or negative charge.
