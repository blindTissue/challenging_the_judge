The total sales of social goods increased by 1.3%, which indicates some growth, but the specifics of the sales categories show mixed results: color TVs increased, clothing was flat, and other products declined. This suggests that while there is some positive movement, it is not uniform across all categories.\n\n2. The Spring Festival, which occurs in February, is a major consumption period in China. The fact that the Chinese New Year and New Year's Day are both in January 1990 means that there was likely a buildup of consumer activity leading up to these holidays. However, the overall increase in sales is modest, and the decline in certain categories indicates that the market may not be as robust as it could be.\n\n3. Now, let's evaluate the options:\n   - A suggests that price control has been effective, but the data does not provide evidence to support this claim.\n   - B implies a significant improvement in market conditions, which is not supported by the mixed sales results.\n   - C states that market sales have not improved significantly, which aligns with the modest overall increase and the declines in some categories.\n   - D claims that New Year's Day is the second consumer peak, but this is not a conclusion we can draw from the provided information.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most accurate conclusion is that while there was a slight increase in sales, the overall market performance does not indicate significant improvement, especially considering the declines in certain product categories.\n\nANSWER: C",

The passage indicates that while seat belts protect drivers and reduce their injuries, they also lead to increased speeds and, consequently, more accidents that harm pedestrians. \n\n1. **Option A** suggests that systems that do not consider the effects of their implementation often fail. This is relevant because the seat belt system has led to unintended negative consequences, indicating a lack of foresight in its implementation.\n\n2. **Option B** states that the seat belt system should be introduced alongside strict speed limits. While this could mitigate some issues, it does not directly address the core problem of unintended consequences.\n\n3. **Option C** implies that seat belts protect drivers at the expense of pedestrians. This is true in the context of the passage, but it does not encompass the broader issue of systemic failure due to unintended consequences.\n\n4. **Option D** posits that institutions can produce undesired results simultaneously. This aligns well with the scenario described, where the seat belt system has led to both reduced driver injuries and increased pedestrian injuries.\n\nConsidering the reasoning above, the best answer is **D**, as it captures the essence of the unintended consequences of the seat belt system.\n\nANSWER: D",

The author discusses various groups of people (the Hima, Iru, Navajo, Hoppies, and indigenous Australians) and their transitions in lifestyle based on their environments and available resources.\n\n1. **Option A** suggests that the environment forces people to accept a certain lifestyle. This is partially true, as the examples show how different groups adapted their livelihoods based on their environments (e.g., livestock for the Hima and Navajo, agriculture for the Iru and indigenous Australians). However, it does not fully capture the adaptability aspect.\n\n2. **Option B** states that people have strong adaptability to the natural environment. This aligns well with the examples, as they illustrate how different groups have changed their lifestyles in response to their environments over time, indicating adaptability.\n\n3. **Option C** posits that different cultural groups can live in harmony. While the examples show coexistence, the focus is more on lifestyle changes rather than harmony.\n\n4. **Option D** claims that geographical environment is not a determinant of human production. This contradicts the examples, which highlight how geography influences lifestyle choices.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best answer is **B**, as it emphasizes the adaptability of people to their environments, which is a central theme in the examples provided.\n\nANSWER: B",

Performance under the planned economy.** - This option implies that the government is taking a more controlling role in the economy, which is characteristic of a planned economy. The announcement of maximum prices indicates a level of control that is not typical in a purely market-driven economy.\n\n4. **D. Price department has national pricing power.** - This option suggests that the price department has the authority to set prices, which aligns with the action of announcing maximum prices. It indicates a level of government intervention in the market.\n\nGiven the context of government intervention to control prices due to market conditions, the most logical inference is that the action reflects characteristics of a planned economy (C) and indicates that the price department has the authority to set prices (D).

This does not establish a connection between the two species, so it does not weaken the conclusion.\n\nB. This option suggests that flower rhododendrons need willow warbler nests to breed. If true, it implies a dependency of the rhododendrons on the warblers, which could suggest that the increase in rhododendrons might affect the warblers negatively. This weakens the conclusion.\n\nC. This option indicates that both species feed on forest pests but not on each other's main food.

The passage highlights that Chinese drama and painting are characterized by their separation from reality, focusing on ambiguity and abstraction rather than realism. This suggests that the \"common spirit of Chinese art\" is rooted in the idea of maintaining a distance from reality to achieve a deeper artistic expression.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Keeping distance from reality is important in Shen Yun and artistic conception. - This aligns with the text's assertion that the strength of Chinese drama lies in its separation from real life, making it a strong candidate.\n\nB. Teach people to relax and teach people to be relieved. - While this may be a benefit of art, it does not capture the essence of the \"common spirit\" discussed in the passage.\n\nC. There should be no separation between art and life. - This contradicts the text, which argues that separation is a strength of Chinese art.\n\nD. Painting, dancing, and music of life events. - This option describes elements of art but does not encapsulate the idea of abstraction and distance from reality emphasized in the passage.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best explanation for the \"common spirit of Chinese art\" is option A, as it directly reflects the text's focus on the importance of distance from reality in Chinese artistic expression.\n\nANSWER: A",

The statement emphasizes that officials need a sense of shame to restrain themselves from exploiting system loopholes. It suggests that shame is a crucial internal motivator that complements external systems and punishments.\n2. The options can be evaluated based on how well they align with this reasoning.\n\n**Option A** states that if officials have a sense of shame, they will not exploit loopholes and will repair them. This aligns with the statement's assertion that shame leads to self-restraint and proactive behavior in addressing issues.\n\n**Option B** suggests that a sense of shame will lead to self-discipline and the elimination of corrupt thoughts. This is also consistent with the idea that shame can prevent corruption.\n\n**Option C** claims that increasing investigations and punishments will deter officials from corruption if they lack shame. While this is a valid point, it does not directly connect to the necessity of shame as highlighted in the statement.\n\n**Option D** states that establishing systems will prevent officials from \"rotting\" if they lack shame. This contradicts the statement, which implies that without shame, systems alone are insufficient.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best options that align with the statement's emphasis on the importance of shame in preventing corruption are A and B.

This contradicts the overall message of the passage, which highlights his success despite disobeying orders.\n- **B** implies that Nelson's decision was based on assessing the situation. While he did assess the situation, the passage focuses more on his choice to ignore the order rather than a careful evaluation.\n- **C** states that Nelson's victory was a miracle due to the retreat signal. While the signal is mentioned, the passage does not frame the victory as miraculous but rather as a result of Nelson's decision to continue fighting.\n- **D** accurately reflects the passage's focus on how Nelson found a reason to disregard superior orders during the battle, emphasizing his defiance and the resulting victory.\n\nBased on this analysis, the best answer is D, as it captures the essence of Nelson's actions and the theme of the passage.\n\nANSWER: D",

        "question": "There are many new technologies born in the field of thermal power, and the combined cycle technology is one of them. In simple terms, the combined cycle technology is \"one gas and two uses\": the high-temperature exhaust gas discharged from the gas turbine is recovered and converted into steam by the waste heat boiler and enters the steam turbine. After driving it to run, both turbines transmit kinetic energy to the generator to generate electricity; the exhaust gas enters the boiler again, which further converts the thermal energy contained in it into kinetic energy and reduces the temperature of the final exhaust gas. This is not only environmentally friendly but also saves fuel. In addition to high power generation efficiency, fast start-up speed is also a great advantage of combined cycle technology. Its working principle is to shut down the slow-running steam turbine at the beginning of a startup, and only start the gas turbine to generate sufficient heat before switching to combined cycle mode. This feature is very useful for large cities with frequent power emergency incidents. Regarding combined cycle technology, what does the following statement do not match the above text?",

        "question": "London is one of the most congested cities in the world, and on the most crowded streets, the speed is even below 12 mph. In the face of this situation, the London government began to charge congestion fees for motor vehicles. It costs ê ¸ per vehicle. For the first time, the congestion in London streets has improved, but over time, the congestion has rebounded. Soon, the congestion has reached a maximum, and the speed of London driving can only be 8 mph. It turns out that before charging congestion fees, many private car owners felt that the city's congestion also had its own responsibility, and unconsciously produced a \"guilt\", thereby intentionally or unintentionally reducing the time spent driving. However, when they paid After the ê ¸ congestion fee, I thought that I had paid the price for \"mistakes\", and that driving trips were straightforward and without guilt. In many cases, we always want the other person to pay for the mistakes made by others. But Sometimes, the best way is to tolerate or even \"allow\" his mistakes. Only in this way can he feel guilty, so that he can remember this mistake for a long time, and never make the same mistake. What does this text mainly explain?",

        "response": "The text discusses the impact of congestion fees on drivers' behavior in London. Initially, drivers felt a sense of guilt about contributing to congestion, which led them to drive less. However, after paying the congestion fee, they felt absolved of that guilt, leading to increased driving and a rebound in congestion. The text suggests that allowing individuals to feel the consequences of their actions (in this case, the guilt associated with contributing to congestion) may be more effective than simply imposing fees, as it encourages them to change their behavior in the long term.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. \"Only consider the rules.\" - This option does not capture the essence of the text, which emphasizes the psychological aspect of guilt rather than just following rules.\n\nB. \"The best way to face traffic congestion in London is tolerance.\" - This option aligns with the text's suggestion that allowing individuals to feel the consequences of their actions (tolerance of mistakes) may lead to better long-term behavior.\n\nC. \"Incomplete transport policy in London.\" - While the text touches on policy, it does not focus on the completeness of the transport policy but rather on the psychological effects of congestion fees.\n\nD. \"People don't follow traffic rules.\" - This option is not the main focus of the text, which is more about the psychological impact of fees rather than rule-following.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best answer is B, as it reflects the text's main argument about the importance of allowing individuals to feel the consequences of their actions to promote better behavior.\n\nANSWER: B",

This is a different structure because it affirms the consequent rather than denying it.\n\nB. This states that everyone who is 70 years old can receive a living allowance. Mr. Wang is 75 years old, so he can receive the allowance. This is also affirming the consequent and does not match the original structure.\n\nC. This states that penguin eggs can be hatched in all suitable conditions, but the eggs on T island are not hatched, so the environment on T island is not suitable. This follows a similar structure: it states a universal condition, presents a specific case that does not meet that condition, and concludes that the specific case does not belong to the universal category.\n\nD. This states that all students admitted to top universities are smart students. Li Ke has not been accepted to top universities, so he is not a smart student. This is also affirming the consequent and does not match the original structure.\n\nThe option that best mirrors the logical structure of the original statement is C, as it follows the same pattern of reasoning.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "response": "To determine which statement must be true based on the provided information, we need to analyze the data given about the weight loss experiment.\n\n1. The average weight loss for all participants is 10 kg, with males averaging 14 kg and females averaging 8 kg. This indicates that the male participants lost more weight on average than female participants.\n\n2. For the overall average to be 10 kg, the number of male and female participants must be such that their combined average results in this figure. If there were more males than females, the overall average would be skewed higher, and if there were more females, it would skew lower.\n\n3. The average weight loss of males (14 kg) is higher than that of females (8 kg). This suggests that if the average for all participants is 10 kg, there must be a balance in the number of participants to achieve this average. \n\n4. If we assume that the number of male participants is less than the number of female participants, the overall average would likely be lower than 10 kg, given that females lost less weight on average. Conversely, if there are more males, the average could be higher than 10 kg.\n\n5. Therefore, for the overall average to be 10 kg, it is more plausible that there are more male participants than female participants, as their higher average weight loss would need to compensate for the lower average of the females.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the only statement that must be true is:\n\nD. More male participants than female participants.\n\nANSWER: D",

        "question": "The lightest elements in the primitive universe are hydrogen and helium. Slightly heavier elements such as carbon are only formed in the nuclear reaction of the planet and will be dispersed when the planet explodes. Although the age of the universe does not exceed two billion Years, but recently discovered gas clouds contain carbon elements billions of years ago. Based on the above views, which of the following is true? ?",
        "answer": "B",

            "Primitive planet contains only hydrogen.",
            "Some planets were formed before the universe reached two billion years of age.",

            "The planet that determines the time is not the same as the gas cloud."
        ],
        "response": "To analyze the question, we need to consider the information provided about the formation of elements in the universe and the timeline of the universe's age.\n\n1. **Option A** states that the primitive planet contains only hydrogen. This is incorrect because while hydrogen is the lightest and most abundant element, helium is also a primary component of the early universe. Therefore, this statement is too restrictive.\n\n2. **Option B** suggests that some planets were formed before the universe reached two billion years of age. The question states that the universe does not exceed two billion years, but it also mentions gas clouds containing carbon elements that are billions of years old. This implies that some matter (like gas clouds) existed before the formation of planets, but it does not confirm that planets themselves formed before the two billion-year mark.\n\n3. **Option C** claims that the carbon in the gas cloud later formed some parts of the planet. This is plausible because carbon can be formed in stars and dispersed into space, eventually contributing to the formation of planets. This aligns with the idea that heavier elements like carbon can exist in gas clouds and later be incorporated into planetary bodies.\n\n4. **Option D** states that the planet that determines the time is not the same as the gas cloud. This is somewhat ambiguous but suggests a distinction between the age of planets and the age of gas clouds. However, it does not directly address the formation of elements or the timeline of the universe.\n\nGiven this analysis, **Option C** is the most accurate statement based on the information provided, as it directly connects the existence of carbon in gas clouds to the formation of planets.\n\nANSWER: C",

        "response": "To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the information provided in the question regarding the role of acetic acid in metabolism, especially in the context of fasting and energy supply.\n\n1. The experimental mice were genetically manipulated to metabolize glucose and fatty acids but not acetic acid. When these mice were fasted for 48 hours, their body temperature and endurance significantly decreased, indicating that the inability to metabolize acetic acid negatively impacted their energy levels during fasting.\n\n2. Option A states that acetic acid plays a vital role in maintaining the body's energy supply. This aligns with the findings that the experimental mice's endurance and body temperature dropped when they could not metabolize acetic acid, suggesting that acetic acid is indeed important for energy supply.\n\n3. Option B suggests that acetic acid can be used as an energy source that does not raise blood sugar. While this may be true, the question emphasizes the role of acetic acid in the context of fasting and energy maintenance rather than its effect on blood sugar.\n\n4. Option C discusses adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as the energy source of life activities, which is a general statement about energy metabolism but does not specifically address the role of acetic acid.\n\n5. Option D mentions fatty acids and ketone bodies as the main sources of ATP during prolonged exercise. While this is accurate, it does not directly relate to the specific role of acetic acid in the context of the experiment.\n\nGiven the context of the experiment and the significant reduction in endurance and body temperature in the absence of acetic acid metabolism, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nANSWER: A",

The average age of residents includes both very young children and very elderly people. The presence of these extreme values (children under 10 and elderly over 90) can skew the mean significantly, making it less representative of the community's average age. Thus, this option is not suitable.\n\nB. The average annual income of young employees is mostly between 100,000 and 120,000 yuan, but the presence of one executive earning over one million yuan is an extreme value that can distort the mean. Therefore, this option is also not suitable.\n\nC. The average height of young people includes all students from preschool to secondary school. This group is more homogeneous in terms of age and development compared to the previous options, making the arithmetic mean a reasonable measure here. Thus, this option is suitable.\n\nD. The average number of left-behind children relies on estimated data in some districts, which introduces vagueness and uncertainty. This lack of accurate data makes it inappropriate for calculating a reliable arithmetic mean.
