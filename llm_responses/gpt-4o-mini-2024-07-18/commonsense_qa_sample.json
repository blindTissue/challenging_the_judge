The phrase \"Brenda spent a lot of effort on washing herself\" suggests that she is concerned about her cleanliness. The options provided relate to the concept of being unclean or dirty.\n\n- A. \"get messy\" - This is not a grammatically correct phrase in this context.\n- B. \"cleaning\" - While she may dislike cleaning, the sentence focuses on her personal hygiene rather than the act of cleaning itself.\n- C. \"get dirty\" - This is also not grammatically correct in this context.\n- D. \"getting dirty\" - This is a valid option, indicating a dislike for the process of becoming dirty.\n- E. \"being dirty\" - This option suggests a dislike for the state of being dirty, which aligns well with her effort in washing herself.\n\nBoth D and E are reasonable, but \"being dirty\" (E) captures the ongoing state she dislikes, while \"getting dirty\" (D) refers to the action that leads to that state. Since the sentence emphasizes her effort in washing, it implies she dislikes the state of being dirty more than the action of becoming dirty.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is E.\n\nANSWER: E",

Own house - Basements in houses can vary in size, but they are often designed to be functional and can be quite large.\nD. Office building - Office buildings may have sizable basements for storage or utilities, so they are not likely to be small.\nE. Art gallery - Art galleries may have basements for storage or exhibitions, but they can also be large.\n\nAmong these options, the closet is the only one that is inherently small, but it does not qualify as a basement.

In a broader context, \"obtuse\" can also refer to something that is not sharp or is dull in understanding.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\nA. Bright - This does not directly contradict \"obtuse,\" as something can be bright and still be obtuse in understanding.\nB. Pointed - This is the opposite of obtuse in a geometric sense, as pointed angles are acute (less than 90 degrees).\nC. Correct - Being obtuse does not inherently mean something cannot be correct; it can still be correct but not sharp in understanding.\nD. Acute angled - This is directly contradictory to obtuse, as acute angles are less than 90 degrees.\nE. Clear - Something can be clear and still be obtuse in understanding.\n\nThe most direct contradiction to \"obtuse\" is option D, \"acute angled,\" as obtuse angles cannot be acute.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\nANSWER: D",
