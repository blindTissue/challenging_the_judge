Plaque – This is the correct term for the fatty deposits in arteries that can rupture and cause blockages elsewhere.\nB. Enamel – This is the hard outer layer of teeth, not related to arteries.\nC. White blood cells – These are part of the immune system and do not form fragments that cause blockages.\nD.

Invisible light refers to parts of the spectrum not visible to the human eye, such as ultraviolet and infrared, which are outside the 400-700 nm range.\n5.

Gases (like oxygen and carbon dioxide) are small, nonpolar molecules that can diffuse directly through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane without the need for transport proteins. Metals, in their elemental form, do not typically cross membranes. Nutrients and specific ions usually require transport proteins or channels to cross the membrane, so they are not generally permeable without assistance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is the one that can pass through the membrane without assistance: gas.\n\nANSWER: B",
