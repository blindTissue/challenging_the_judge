Arm robbers – Guns can be used to arm robbers, and arming robbers is illegal.\n\nE. Break – Breaking is a mechanical failure, not an illegal act.\n\nBetween B and D, both involve illegal acts, but \"take life\" (B) is more directly associated with an illegal outcome (e.g., homicide), while \"arm robbers\" (D) is more about enabling a crime.
