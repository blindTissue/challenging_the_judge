There were no predators to control the population.  \nWith wolves gone, there were no natural predators for the moose.

        "response": "Let's break down each option:\n\nA. Geothermal heating: This refers to heat from Earth's interior. While it does contribute to some localized currents (like hydrothermal vents), it is not the main driver of global ocean circulation.\n\nB. Planetary rotation: Earth's rotation affects the direction of currents (via the Coriolis effect), but it does not provide the primary energy source.\n\nC. Solar heating: The Sun heats Earth's surface unevenly, causing differences in water temperature and density. This creates wind and drives large-scale ocean currents through processes like wind-driven surface currents and thermohaline circulation.\n\nD. Lunar tidal forces: The Moon's gravity causes tides, which move water, but tides are not the main driver of the overall circulation of ocean currents.\n\nThe primary energy source is solar heating, as it initiates the temperature and density differences that drive most ocean currents.\n\nANSWER: C",

A hard metal case with flexible foam lining  \n- The hard metal provides strong external protection against impacts.\n- The flexible foam lining cushions the eggs, absorbing shocks and preventing them from moving around.\n\nB. A flexible metal case with smooth plastic lining  \n- Flexible metal may not protect well against impacts.\n- Smooth plastic lining does not cushion the eggs.\n\nC. A strong wooden case with lightweight plastic lining  \n- Strong wood offers good protection, but lightweight plastic lining may not cushion the eggs well.\n\nD. A lightweight wooden case with strong aluminum lining  \n- Lightweight wood and aluminum may not provide as much impact protection or cushioning.\n\nThe best option is A, as it combines a strong exterior with a shock-absorbing interior, which is ideal for protecting fragile eggs.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "response": "Let's break down the options:\n\n- Halite (A) is common in sedimentary rocks (like rock salt) but not typically found in igneous or metamorphic rocks because it dissolves easily and can't withstand high temperatures and pressures.\n- Quartz (B) is very stable and resistant to weathering. It is a major component of many igneous rocks (like granite), sedimentary rocks (like sandstone), and metamorphic rocks (like quartzite).\n- Gypsum (C) is mostly found in sedimentary rocks and is not stable at the high temperatures and pressures of igneous and metamorphic environments.\n- Sulfur (D) is found in some sedimentary deposits and volcanic areas, but is not a common mineral in all three rock types.\n\nTherefore, quartz is the mineral most likely to be found in all three major rock types.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "response": "Let's break down the Hardy-Weinberg law. This law states that allele and genotype frequencies in a population will remain constant from generation to generation in the absence of evolutionary influences. The main conditions required are: a large population size, no mutation, no migration, random mating, and no natural selection.\n\n- Option A (\"the population is small\") is incorrect because small populations are more affected by genetic drift, which violates Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\n- Option B and C (migration/immigration) are incorrect because gene flow (movement of individuals in or out) changes allele frequencies, violating the law.\n- Option D (\"the population is large\") is correct because a large population minimizes the effects of genetic drift, which is a key requirement for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\n\nANSWER: D",
