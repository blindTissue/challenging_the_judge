On physical examination, she has a body mass index of 35. A random blood glucose value is 132 mg/dL. The next day, fasting blood glucose is 120 mg/dL, followed by a value of 122 mg/ dL on the following day. She is given an oral glucose tolerance test, and her blood glucose is 240 mg/dL 2 hours after receiving the standard 75-g glucose dose. On the basis of these findings, she is prescribed an oral thiazolidinedione (TZD) drug. After 2 months of therapy, her fasting blood glucose is 90 mg/ dL.

Their main mechanism is to improve insulin sensitivity, especially in adipose tissue, muscle, and liver.\n\n**Mechanism of Action:**\n- TZDs activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a nuclear receptor found mainly in adipocytes.\n- Activation of PPARγ leads to changes in gene expression that increase insulin sensitivity.\n\n**Reviewing the options:**\n- **A. Activation of PPARg nuclear receptor in adipocytes**: This is the primary mechanism of TZDs.\n- **B. Decreased production of insulin autoantibodies**: This is relevant to type 1 diabetes, not type 2.\n- **C. Greater density of insulin receptors in adipocytes**: TZDs do not primarily increase receptor density; they improve signaling downstream.\n- **D.

Walk downhill – Walking downhill puts the knee in a position where the quadriceps must control forward movement, and the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) prevents the tibia from sliding forward. Without the ACL, this activity is difficult due to instability and risk of the tibia moving forward.\n\nB. Walk uphill – This requires more hamstring and gluteal strength, but does not stress the ACL as much as downhill walking.\n\nC. Sit cross leg – This is more related to hip and knee flexibility, not specifically stressing the ACL.\n\nD. Getting up from sitting – This involves knee extension, but not as much anterior tibial translation as walking downhill.\n\nTherefore, walking downhill is most difficult for a patient with an ACL-deficient knee due to instability from lack of anterior restraint.\n\nANSWER: A",

The clinical presentation (bloody NG output, hematocrit drop) supports this.\n\n2. **Management priorities:**  \n   - The patient is acutely bleeding and unstable (hematocrit drop).\n   - The first step is to stabilize the patient (IV fluids, blood products as needed).\n   - The next step is to control the bleeding and identify the source.\n\n3. **Options analysis:**\n   - **A. Urgent upper GI contrast study:** Not appropriate in acute GI bleeding; risk of aspiration and does not allow for intervention.\n   - **B. Immediate selective arteriography:** Not first-line; used if endoscopy fails or is unavailable.\n   - **C.

Pubertal growth of pubic hair (pubarche) in females is actually due to increased, not decreased, adrenal androgens (mainly DHEA and DHEAS).\n\nB. Low level of estrogen at puberty  \n- This is incorrect. Estrogen is responsible for breast development (thelarche) and growth spurt, but not directly for pubic hair growth.\n\nC. Pulsatile release of GnRh during sleep  \n- While this is important for the initiation of puberty and the activation of the HPO axis, it is not directly responsible for pubic hair growth.\n\nD. Increased sensitivity of HPO axis to estrogen  \n- This is incorrect. Increased sensitivity of the HPO axis to estrogen is related to the regulation of gonadotropin release, not directly to pubic hair growth.\n\nThe correct answer is that pubic hair growth in females at puberty is due to increased adrenal androgens, which is not directly listed, but the closest relevant mechanism among the options is the pulsatile release of GnRH, as it initiates puberty and indirectly leads to increased adrenal androgen production.\n\nHowever, strictly speaking, none of the options directly state \"increased adrenal androgens,\" but C is the most relevant to the process.\n\nANSWER: C",

This typically happens when the ultrasound waves encounter a highly reflective or absorptive structure, such as bone or a gallstone. The main reason for the shadow is that the sound waves are either reflected back or absorbed, so very few or no waves pass through to the area behind the structure, resulting in a shadow.\n\nAmong the options:\n- A. \"Aefact\" seems to be a misspelling of \"artifact,\" which is a general term for image anomalies, not a specific cause.\n- B. Absorption means the energy of the ultrasound is taken up by the tissue, but this alone doesn't usually cause a sharp shadow.\n- C. Reflection is when the ultrasound waves bounce back from a surface, such as bone or stones, preventing waves from passing through and causing a shadow.\n- D. Refraction is the bending of waves, which can cause displacement of structures but not a shadow.\n\nThe primary cause of acoustic shadow is strong reflection (and sometimes absorption), but reflection is the main mechanism.\n\nANSWER: C",

Carbon monoxide poisoning: CO binds to hemoglobin, reducing oxygen saturation despite high pO2. This fits the low O2 saturation with high pO2. However, CO poisoning usually does not cause respiratory alkalosis (high pH, low pCO2).\n\nB. Ventilatory malfunction: This is vague, but usually, ventilatory failure leads to respiratory acidosis, not alkalosis.\n\nC.

Methyl alcohol poisoning: This causes metabolic acidosis, not alkalosis.\n\nThe key is the combination of high pO2 and low O2 saturation, which is classic for carbon monoxide poisoning, as CO prevents hemoglobin from binding oxygen even when pO2 is high.

        "response": "Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Pulmonary atresia without VSD  \nProstaglandin E (PGE) keeps the ductus arteriosus open, which is beneficial in pulmonary atresia without VSD because it allows blood to reach the lungs.\n\nB. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome  \nPGE is essential here to maintain systemic blood flow via the ductus arteriosus.\n\nC. Obstructive TAPVC (Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection)  \nIn obstructive TAPVC, the problem is pulmonary venous return obstruction, not ductal patency. PGE does not help and can worsen pulmonary congestion by increasing pulmonary blood flow, exacerbating pulmonary edema and respiratory distress.\n\nD. Aortic arch interruption  \nPGE is beneficial to maintain systemic perfusion via the ductus.\n\nTherefore, the condition worsened by prostaglandin E infusion is obstructive TAPVC.\n\nANSWER: C",

Persistent cough – Respiratory symptoms can be present, but they are not the most common.\nC. Failure to thrive – This refers to poor weight gain and growth, which is a very common and early sign of AIDS in infants due to chronic illness and malnutrition.\nD. Lymphadenopathy – Swollen lymph nodes can occur, but are less specific and less common as a presenting symptom than failure to thrive.\n\nFailure to thrive is widely recognized as the most common and earliest symptom of AIDS in infants, as it reflects the overall impact of the disease on growth and development.\n\nANSWER: C",

Electrical burns – In electrical burns, the passage of electric current through bone can cause the deposition of calcium salts in concentric layers, giving a characteristic \"bone pearl\" appearance on histology.\n\nB. Hydrocution – This refers to sudden death due to immersion in cold water, not associated with bone changes.\n\nC. Strangulation – This is mechanical asphyxia by constriction of the neck, not associated with bone pearl appearance.\n\nD. Throttling – This is manual strangulation, also not associated with bone pearl appearance.\n\nTherefore, the \"bone pearl\" appearance is specifically seen in electrical burns due to the effect of electric current on bone tissue.\n\nANSWER: A",
