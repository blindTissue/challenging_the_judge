Most of the families in these two universities have hired part-time workers for various household chores.  \n- If most families already have help for chores, the time-saving benefit of net vegetables is reduced or eliminated, weakening the argument that the service will be welcomed for its convenience.\n\nC.

The victim confirmed the attacker by listening to a digital telephone recording.  \n- This uses voice, which is a behavioral biometric trait. However, the victim is identifying the attacker by recognition, not by a biometric system matching the voice to a database. This is not a direct use of biometric technology.\n\nB. The police used an online ordering system to identify suspects.  \n- This relies on information from a database, not on physiological or behavioral characteristics. No biometric technology is involved.\n\nC. Access control requires entering a password and handwriting a name on a screen.  \n- Passwords are not biometric. Handwriting could be a behavioral biometric, but in this case, it is just writing a name, not analyzing the handwriting for identification. So, this is not a biometric system.\n\nD.

        "response": "Let's analyze the argument and the answer choices step by step:\n\n**Argument:**  \nThe company’s economic benefits have increased year by year since implementing the target term responsibility system for the manager’s term. The conclusion is that only by implementing this system can Company A’s economic benefits increase steadily.\n\n**To weaken the argument:**  \nWe need to show that the increase in economic benefits could be due to other factors, or that the system is not the only reason for the improvement.\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n\nA. If the entire industry and economy are doing well, Company A’s improvement might be due to external factors, not just the new system. This weakens the argument.\n\nB. If another company (Company B) that did NOT implement the system also saw steady increases, it suggests the system is not necessary for improvement. This directly challenges the claim that only the system can bring steady growth.\n\nC. If Company A also implemented a salary management reform that motivated employees, this could be another reason for the improvement, weakening the argument that only the target term responsibility system is responsible.\n\nD. If Company A would have grown even faster without the system, this not only weakens but actually contradicts the argument, showing the system might even be a hindrance.\n\n**Best Answer:**  \nWhile A, C, and D all weaken the argument to some extent, **B** most directly challenges the necessity of the system by providing a clear counterexample: another company achieved the same results without the system.\n\nANSWER: B",

However, it does not say they will \"generally not find\" loopholes, just that they won't exploit them. The first part is not supported.\n\n**B.** If officials have a certain degree of shame, they will strengthen self-discipline, and will not intentionally use the loopholes of the system to eliminate the idea of corruption from their hearts.  \n- This matches the passage: officials with shame will restrain themselves and not exploit loopholes, thus \"do not want to rot.\" The idea of self-discipline and not using loopholes is directly supported.\n\n**C.** If officials lack the necessary shame, as long as they increase investigations and punishment, they will never tolerate weakness, they will not dare to rot.  \n- The passage says increasing investigation and punishment makes officials \"dare not to rot,\" but it does not say this is sufficient if they lack shame. The passage suggests that without shame, relying only on systems is not enough.\n\n**D.** If officials lack the necessary shame, as long as they establish and improve relevant systems for the operation of power, they will not \"rot\".  \n- The passage explicitly says that if officials lack shame and rely only on systems, they will find loopholes and exploit them.

He continued to command bravely and ultimately achieved victory, forcing Denmark to agree to a truce.\n\n- Option A says the theme is about the importance of discipline and criticizes Nelson for not following orders. However, the passage does not focus on criticizing Nelson; instead, it highlights his bravery and the positive outcome.\n- Option B affirms Nelson's decision to act based on the actual situation, suggesting that sometimes it is right to disobey orders if the situation demands it. This matches the passage, which presents Nelson's decision in a positive light and shows that his judgment led to victory.\n- Option C claims the passage is about the victory being a miracle because of the retreat signal. While the passage mentions the retreat signal, it does not focus on the victory being a miracle, but rather on Nelson's decision-making.\n- Option D says the theme is about how Nelson found a reason not to execute orders. This is too narrow and focuses on the excuse rather than the broader theme of decision-making and leadership.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is B, as it captures the main idea: Nelson's decision to act according to the situation, even if it meant not following orders, is affirmed.\n\nANSWER: B",

        "question": "There are many new technologies born in the field of thermal power, and the combined cycle technology is one of them. In simple terms, the combined cycle technology is \"one gas and two uses\": the high-temperature exhaust gas discharged from the gas turbine is recovered and converted into steam by the waste heat boiler and enters the steam turbine. After driving it to run, both turbines transmit kinetic energy to the generator to generate electricity; the exhaust gas enters the boiler again, which further converts the thermal energy contained in it into kinetic energy and reduces the temperature of the final exhaust gas. This is not only environmentally friendly but also saves fuel. In addition to high power generation efficiency, fast start-up speed is also a great advantage of combined cycle technology. Its working principle is to shut down the slow-running steam turbine at the beginning of a startup, and only start the gas turbine to generate sufficient heat before switching to combined cycle mode.

        "question": "London is one of the most congested cities in the world, and on the most crowded streets, the speed is even below 12 mph. In the face of this situation, the London government began to charge congestion fees for motor vehicles. It costs ꠸ per vehicle. For the first time, the congestion in London streets has improved, but over time, the congestion has rebounded. Soon, the congestion has reached a maximum, and the speed of London driving can only be 8 mph. It turns out that before charging congestion fees, many private car owners felt that the city's congestion also had its own responsibility, and unconsciously produced a \"guilt\", thereby intentionally or unintentionally reducing the time spent driving. However, when they paid After the ꠸ congestion fee, I thought that I had paid the price for \"mistakes\", and that driving trips were straightforward and without guilt. In many cases, we always want the other person to pay for the mistakes made by others. But Sometimes, the best way is to tolerate or even \"allow\" his mistakes.

After paying the fee, they felt justified and drove more, worsening congestion.\n3. The passage then generalizes this to say that sometimes, making people pay for their mistakes removes their sense of guilt, and that tolerance (allowing them to feel guilt) can be more effective in changing behavior.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Only consider the rules.  \n- The passage is not about strictly following rules, but about the psychological effects of policies.\n\nB. The best way to face traffic congestion in London is tolerance.  \n- The passage uses the London example to argue that tolerance (allowing people to feel guilt) can be more effective than punitive measures.\n\nC.

Let's suppose all 15 boys like axiomatic set theory, and only 5 of them also like model theory. That would mean 10 boys like only axiomatic set theory. But then, the number of people who like only axiomatic set theory would be at least 10 (boys) + any girls who like only axiomatic set theory. But the total who like only axiomatic set theory cannot exceed 5 (since 20 like axiomatic set theory, and the minimum overlap is 15). So, it's not possible for 10 boys to like only axiomatic set theory.\n\nTherefore, D is not possible.\n\nANSWER: D",

        "question": "The lightest elements in the primitive universe are hydrogen and helium. Slightly heavier elements such as carbon are only formed in the nuclear reaction of the planet and will be dispersed when the planet explodes. Although the age of the universe does not exceed two billion Years, but recently discovered gas clouds contain carbon elements billions of years ago. Based on the above views, which of the following is true? ?",
        "answer": "B",

            "Primitive planet contains only hydrogen.",
            "Some planets were formed before the universe reached two billion years of age.",

            "The planet that determines the time is not the same as the gas cloud."
        ],
        "response": "Let's analyze the information:\n\n- The primitive universe had only hydrogen and helium.\n- Heavier elements like carbon are formed in stars (not planets) and are dispersed when stars explode (supernova).\n- Gas clouds with carbon were found that existed billions of years ago, even though the universe was less than two billion years old at that time.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Primitive planet contains only hydrogen.  \nIncorrect. The primitive universe contained hydrogen and helium, not just hydrogen.\n\nB. Some planets were formed before the universe reached two billion years of age.  \nIrrelevant. The passage discusses stars and gas clouds, not planets specifically.\n\nC. The carbon in the gas cloud later formed some parts of the planet.  \nNot directly supported. The passage does not state what the carbon in the gas cloud became.\n\nD. The planet that determines the time is not the same as the gas cloud.  \nThis is vague and not directly supported by the passage.\n\nHowever, the key point is that the discovery of carbon in ancient gas clouds implies that some stars (which produce carbon) must have formed, lived, and exploded before the universe was two billion years old. This means that the process of star formation and supernovae happened very early, dispersing carbon into the gas clouds.\n\nOf the options, B is the closest, as it suggests that some celestial bodies (planets, but more accurately stars) formed early. While the wording is not perfect, B is the most reasonable inference.\n\nANSWER: B",
