Nutrients and specific ions often require transport proteins to cross, but some nutrients (like small molecules) can diffuse, and ions typically require specific channels.\n\nBetween the options, gases are the most universally permeable without special transport mechanisms.\n\nANSWER: B",

Over time, repeated eruptions build up layers of solidified lava and volcanic ash, creating the structure of a volcano. \n\nLimestone is a type of sedimentary rock, not directly involved in creating volcanoes. The crust is the Earth's outer layer, but it doesn't \"create\" volcanoes; rather, volcanoes form within or through the crust. \"Rock\" is a general term and doesn't specify the layers that build a volcano.\n\nTherefore, the layers of lava (and volcanic ash) create a volcano.\n\nANSWER: A",

        "response": "Halogens typically have an oxidation number of -1 in compounds. To give a halogen a positive oxidation number, it must be combined with elements that are more electronegative or have higher oxidation states, effectively \"oxidizing\" the halogen.\n\n- Carbon (A): Usually has a positive oxidation state, but not necessarily in a way that makes halogens positive.\n- Nitrogen (B): Similar to carbon, but not directly relevant here.\n- Calcium (C): An alkaline earth metal, which tends to be +2, and when combined with halogens, the halogen remains negative.\n- Oxygen (D): Has a high electronegativity and typically forms negative oxidation states (-2). Combining with oxygen would not give the halogen a positive oxidation number.\n\nThe key is that to make a halogen positive, it must be combined with a more electronegative element or in a context where it is oxidized. The most common scenario is halogens in compounds with metals like calcium, but calcium itself is +2, and in compounds with halogens, the halogen remains negative.\n\nHowever, the question asks what must be combined with a halogen to give it a positive oxidation number. The typical case is when halogens are combined with elements that are less electronegative or in oxidation states that can \"oxidize\" the halogen.\n\nGiven the options, none directly cause the halogen to become positive unless the halogen is in a compound where it is oxidized. But in common chemistry, oxygen tends to oxidize other elements, not the other way around.\n\n**Conclusion:** The best answer based on typical oxidation states and common compounds is **calcium**, which can form compounds where the halogen is in a positive oxidation state (e.g., in certain compounds like calcium halides, the halogen is negative, but in some oxidation states, halogens can be positive in other contexts). \n\nBut more precisely, to give a halogen a positive oxidation number, it must be combined with an element that can oxidize it, which is often a less electronegative element or a metal. Since calcium is a metal and can form compounds where the halogen is in a negative oxidation state, but in some cases, halogens can be oxidized to positive states when combined with certain elements.\n\n**Final reasoning:** The question is somewhat tricky, but the most logical choice is **calcium** because it is a metal that can form compounds where the halogen's oxidation state can be positive under certain conditions.\n\nANSWER: C",
