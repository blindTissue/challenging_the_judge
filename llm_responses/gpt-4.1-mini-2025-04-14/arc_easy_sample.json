Farming: Traditional and intensive farming often involves plowing and removing natural vegetation, which exposes soil to wind and water erosion, leading to loss of topsoil.\n\n- B. Restoring wetlands: This generally helps reduce erosion by stabilizing soil and improving water retention.\n\n- C. Species reintroduction: While it can affect ecosystems, it is unlikely to have a major direct impact on soil erosion rates.\n\n- D.

No tilt means no variation in sunlight angle throughout the year, so no seasons. This is true.  \nB. The length of the Earth year depends on its orbit around the sun, not the tilt. So, no change in year length. False.  \nC. The Earth's spin rate (rotation period) is independent of its axial tilt. False.  \nD.

Ocean currents are primarily driven by differences in water temperature and salinity, which affect water density and create movement.\n\nStep 2: Consider each option:\n- A. Geothermal heating: This affects deep ocean temperatures but is minimal compared to surface heating.\n- B. Planetary rotation: The Coriolis effect influences the direction of currents but does not provide energy.\n- C. Solar heating: The Sun heats the Earth's surface unevenly, causing temperature gradients that drive wind patterns and ocean circulation.\n- D. Lunar tidal forces: Tides influence water movement locally but are not the primary driver of large-scale ocean currents.\n\nStep 3: Conclusion: Solar heating is the main energy source causing temperature differences that drive wind and ocean currents.\n\nANSWER: C",
