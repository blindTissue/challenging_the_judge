Since cider is made from apples, the most relevant location is an orchard, where apple trees grow and bees pollinate the flowers.\n\nStep 4: Determine where you should be careful of bees after drinking cider.

Closet: A closet is a small storage space inside a building, not a building itself, so it doesn't have a basement.\n- C. Own house: Houses often have basements, size varies but generally moderate.\n- D. Office building: Office buildings can have large basements for utilities, parking, or storage.\n- E. Art gallery: May or may not have basements, but if present, could be moderate in size.\n\nStep 3: The question asks where a basement is likely to be small.\n\n- Since a closet is not a building, it cannot have a basement.\n- Among the buildings, a church, office building, or house usually have moderate to large basements.\n- An art gallery is often smaller and may have a small basement or none at all.\n\nStep 4: However, the question is about where a basement is likely to be small.\n\n- A closet is not a building, so no basement.\n- A church, office building, or house usually have larger basements.\n- An art gallery is often smaller in scale, so if it has a basement, it is likely to be small.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is E. art gallery.\n\nANSWER: E",

She is likely expressing that it would be beneficial or supportive to her.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the options:\n- A. get things done — This is a phrase meaning to complete tasks, but it doesn't directly express the mother's feeling or the result.\n- B. complete tasks — Similar to A, it describes the action, not the effect on the mother.\n- C. helpful — This describes the effect on the mother; if the son does his chores, it would be helpful to her.\n- D. finished product — This refers to the result of work, not the mother's perspective.\n- E. gain — This is vague and less appropriate in this context.\n\nStep 4: The best choice that fits the mother's perspective is \"helpful.\"\n\nANSWER: C",
