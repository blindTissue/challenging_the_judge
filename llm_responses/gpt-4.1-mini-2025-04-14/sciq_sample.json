Parasites typically harm the host but do not benefit it. Predators kill the host, so they do not benefit the host. Viruses harm the host and do not benefit it. The host is the organism being affected, not the species benefiting and harming.\n\nStep 3: Consider mutualism and parasitism:\nA species that both benefits and harms the host is often involved in a relationship called \"parasitoid\" or \"facultative parasite,\" but these are not options. Since none of the options perfectly fit, the closest is \"parasite,\" as it harms and benefits itself, but harms the host.\n\nHowever, the question specifically says \"benefits and harms the host,\" meaning the host is both helped and harmed. This describes a \"parasite\" that can sometimes provide benefits (e.g., gut flora that can be parasitic but also beneficial). So the best fit is \"parasite.\"\n\nANSWER: C",

Chlorophyll – Both seeds and spores come from plants that have chlorophyll, but seeds themselves do not contain chlorophyll. Spores also do not contain chlorophyll. This is not a distinguishing feature.  \nB. DNA – Both seeds and spores contain DNA, as they are living cells. This is not unique to seeds.  \nC. Pollinators – Pollinators are animals or agents that transfer pollen; they are not part of seeds or spores themselves. This is irrelevant.  \nD. A supply of stored food – Seeds contain stored food (endosperm or cotyledons) to nourish the developing embryo. Spores do not have stored food; they rely on immediate germination.\n\nStep 3: Conclusion  \nThe key difference is that seeds have a supply of stored food, while spores do not.\n\nANSWER: D",
