        "question": "There are many new technologies born in the field of thermal power, and the combined cycle technology is one of them. In simple terms, the combined cycle technology is \"one gas and two uses\": the high-temperature exhaust gas discharged from the gas turbine is recovered and converted into steam by the waste heat boiler and enters the steam turbine. After driving it to run, both turbines transmit kinetic energy to the generator to generate electricity; the exhaust gas enters the boiler again, which further converts the thermal energy contained in it into kinetic energy and reduces the temperature of the final exhaust gas. This is not only environmentally friendly but also saves fuel. In addition to high power generation efficiency, fast start-up speed is also a great advantage of combined cycle technology. Its working principle is to shut down the slow-running steam turbine at the beginning of a startup, and only start the gas turbine to generate sufficient heat before switching to combined cycle mode. This feature is very useful for large cities with frequent power emergency incidents. Regarding combined cycle technology, what does the following statement do not match the above text?",
